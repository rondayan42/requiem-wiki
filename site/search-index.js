It is understood that you may have a better image, but please respect the work the previous user put in. It doesn't take long to send them a message. The only exceptions to this is if the users image does not work properly (ie. broken link), isnt formatted correctly (i.e should be an image and not a link), or if the game is updated in a way in which the old image is obselete (ie. They made a new part of the armor visible, etc). Otherwise, if you feel an additional image is needed, please add it to our graphics light version. 2. Please try and keep images small enough to prevent page stretching. If you wish to keep a large file, please create a thumbnail view.( When all images are finally in place some formatting might occur in order to keep the page in \"order\") 3. If you can please provide a front and back view. More views are great as well. 4. Links to other Req Wiki pages are preferred, to help prevent formatting issues. 5.

They are easily enraged against their enemies, a serious weakness that is sometimes exploited to make them lose control. Bartuks are absolutely generous to their allies, and fight alongside them with a strong sense of solidarity. They make their decisions simply: assist the friend, smash the enemy. Magic wielding Bartuks are generally limited to the black arts and fire magic, and lack the intelligence to use most sophisticated magic. Combat Style Bartuks focus on strength based physical weapon combat, foregoing shields to use heavy Two-Handed Weapons. Bartuk magic is usually limited to curse magic or low level support magic. However, Bartuk magic is unfamiliar to the other races, making it difficult for the other races to counter Bartuk spells. Race Relations Bartuks have a deep seated hatred toward the Xenoas since they've been historically dominated by them, but now they know how to exploit the Xenoas' weaknesses. Bartuks can cooperate with the Kruxenas , but loathe the Turans and Xenoas.

There are different kinds of Possession Beast, each with the own unique skills, that grow and develop along with the character. Quest Players can begin the quest to obtain a Possession Beast once his or her character reaches Level 23. This is a long quest chain called Forgotten Relics in Crescent that consists of 13 parts and can only be completed once. The first part of the quest comes from an NPC in Valdes named Elian, found in the unidentified room located south of the Official Residence. If questing in Turba, it can be obtained from the Mayor in Zakate. If the Possession Beast obtained from this quest is destroyed, or if more Possession Beasts are desired, then players must collect Pieces of Possession Beast from monsters.\n[Image: ] Obtaining Nightmare monsters at Level 32 or above will drop Pieces of Possession Beast Pieces at a certain probability. There are four types of Possession Beast Pieces that will create a Possession Beast when combined. These Pieces of Possession Beast can be traded among players at the Auction Hall.  You do not need to complete the quest in order to purchase and combine the pieces. Usage Possession Beasts are very powerful, but their usage is limited. Characters can only transform into a Possession Beast after filling the Hardcore Gauge to at least 90%, which slowly fills as players kill monsters. The Hardcore gauge is displayed in the character target window. Transforming into a Possession Beast is similar to how players use skills. Players can click the Possession Beast icon (In the 'Possession Beast' Menu), or drag and drop the icon into the shortcut bar, and then press the corresponding Shortcut key. Players can then use the skills of their Possession Beast in a similar fashion.

Equipment Choices LVL 60 Reinforced Mirage Filled with HP . Lvl 50 Reinforced Thunder Staff also reinforced with mostly HP I am looking at going wand and sheild, not a for sure thing yet. Skills Healing Healing Totem lvl 2 Home Remedy lvl 5 Just to help me regen between battles. Passive Vindictive Mind lvl 9 You will want to max this.

Put the pionts in Loas curse) Fire Rain lvl 1 (at 1 point during reskill I had to take) I have taken no weapon mastery at all because I have taken no mele skills at all. DNA Fire Ball lvl 5 Burning Hell lvl 5 I had mana amulet here but I have no need for it in DNA any more. Long Range Burning Hell lvl 5 Fire Coat lvl 5 Flame Shield lvl 5 Rationale I built TauJuk this way for two reasons. 1)  I wanted to deal massive AOE dmg    2) Stay alive doing so. I have crits with fire ball as high as 995, w/burning hell as high as 1140 .Burning Meteor crits as high as 1248, even my staff crits better than 450. When Buffed my HP is  2950+ and my MP is over 2850+ I added a costume so add 500/500 mp/hp He's like the energizer bunny - he just keeps going and going. Future TauJuk is now (04-06-09) at lvl 63 . I will edit skill points as I lvl. I am considering a re-skill in the next few weeks. A lot depends on possible skill changes by Gravity. If the changes outlined and implemented by Korea are followed by Gravity then I think a re-skill is in order. This would include a large boost to Healing Totem and because of the SvS battle feild I would skill in Chaos Totem and Loas Curse.

In order for the posession to work the animal must remain in the skills range. Otherwise the attempt will fail. If you sucessfully complete the skill and capture the animal, it will be assigned a \"usage bar\" as seen on the left. On the contrary, if you complete it and fail, the animal will attack you. Skill Bar The buttons marked 1, 2, and 3 control what your pet does. 1) This is the manual button. When you have this selected you must tell your pet what to do, by clicking the attack button (B) or the retreat button (A). 2) This is defense mode. Your pet will automatically attack if something attacks you. 3) This is a \"free for all\" mode. Your pet will attack any monster near by on it's own (rather you select it or not). Notes There are a couple of things to note about pets with this skill. 1) They CAN die, and at the moment they do not \"self heal\". However, there is a trick to this. If your pet drops to far in it's HP's, just log out then back in or go into the nearest city. It will return to full health/mana. Another way to protect it's hp's is to put it in defense mode and you attack first, so monster swarm after you instead of trying to kill your pet. 2) Some quest monsters WILL attack your pet. In particular, for the quest to protect \"Karin\" (the missing child), the Quest Nis's will go straight for your pet when you walk by on your way to Karin. It is possible that other Quest Monsters and hostile monsters will gun for your pet without warning, but this is NOT confirmed. 3) When the time has run out on control of your animal, it will attack you. So be careful. However, I avoided an attack by riding the wingrider and going into the city (luckily just as the time ran out). Notice: The above guide is just a skeleton. If you have things to confirm or add, please do assist.

Each individual DNA is designed to complement one particular skill. For Example: There is a DNA to increase the HP Recovery of the Templar spell Lesser Heal . Another available DNA is designed to lower it's MP Consumption. Yet another available DNA is designed to lower it's Casting Time. Although some skills have multiple DNA designed to enhance their function, not every skill has a DNA available to enhance it. Additionally, there is currently no known DNA available for Advanced job skills. Each character has 5 DNA slots that they can fill with DNA. You may view your currently slotted DNA in the Skill Window (Default UI Shortcut: K) under the DNA tab. Levels of DNA Each individual DNA has a number of levels associated with it. Higher levels of DNA bestow greater effects. The number of DNA levels available generally correspond to the number of levels available for the skill that that DNA is designed to enhance. In order to purchase a DNA of a particular level you must already own the corresponding skill of the same level. Altering DNA In order to alter any of your DNA you must visit a DNA Engineer NPC located in the major towns and some outposts. DNA Engineers allow you to: Buy a DNA for a new slot. Upgrade an already slotted DNA to a higher level. Change an already slotted DNA to any other DNA. Remove any DNA you already have slotted. In order to accomplish any of the above, right click the DNA Engineer to open the DNA System Window. All DNA available to your character will be listed on the left side. Now simply drag the new DNA you wish to have to a DNA slot on the right. If that slot is already occupied, the new DNA will take it's place. To remove an already slotted DNA, drag and release it away from any DNA slots. Any time changes are made, a cost is associated with finalizing the DNA choices. This cost is based solely on the number of DNA slotted and is not affected by the levels of DNA slotted or the number of DNA changed in a particular transaction. The cost for altering DNA is as follows: Number of DNA slotted Cost 1 slot filled 100 Lant 2 slots filled 1,000 Lant 3 slots filled 10,000 Lant 4 slots filled 100,000 Lant 5 slots filled 1,000,000 Lant Removal of any already slotted DNA is free. Hidden DNA A quote on Hidden DNA from the REQUIEM website: \" Hidden Function of DNA System A hidden DNA bonus will occasionally appear when all 5 of a character's DNA Slots are filled. The addition of the bonus DNA makes a total of 6 possible DNA enhancements for each character. \" [1] As of the end of REQUIEM Open Beta (June 12, 2008) the hidden DNA system was not yet implemented.

Use both for constant DoT. Relapse Wound (5) Lower your targets defense, to allow your Summons to do more damage. AoE Blood Storm (5) Very good damage whether you have multiple targets or not. Blood Moon (3) Melee AoE. Control Shadow Binding (5) With Max DNA, this skill can stop a target in its tracks for 20 seconds, useful for keeping it away from you or your illusion, and holding in Blood Storm target area. Defensive Buffs Counterattack (5) Very useful defensive skill, with Offensive capabilities.  Good protection when your Illusion has been killed. Soul Shield (5) Damage reduction is a must especially against Elite or Nightmare creatures. Invisibility (3) Evasion rate boost(%). Only castable on self. Can be moded with DNA. Blessing of Wind (Instead of Invisibility) Evasion rate boost (Stat value). Castable on any friendly. Many prefer this to Invisibility. Summons Summon Illusion Use as your meat shield.  Useless in PvP, but in PvE, its a must Summon Kazara (6) Good melee attack damage.  Use as you tank, or to pull in distant foes. Summon Lenatore Ranged attack damage.  One of the more troublesome Summons, but has high damage. Summon Nastech Magic attack damage. Gets to level 70 when maxed out. Summon Ennon Magic attack damage, plus will heal other Summons for a small amount when they drop below 50% health. Gets to level 70 when maxed out. Supportive Skills Familiar Lesser Heal (1) Actually called Summoned Monster Lesser Heal, this skill allows you to restore a small amount of HP to a target summon. Very small. Equipment Choices Attributes and Reinforcement INT Get this stat high, as it increase spell damage at 0.3 per point. MND Try to increase this to a point where you can get into a big AoE, and still not have your MP deplete totally. HP For & Against For - Many people say that casters dont need a lot of health cos they are in the back line.  With solo PvE however, this usually isnt the case, so I would suggest to put as many HP reinforcements on as possible. Against - HP is not nearly as important for this caster because you should have at least 1 Summon leveled to be your personal tank. No, that doesn't mean you wont be hit, just that you aren't nearly as likely to be. When you get beyond lv46, try to have the Lab CI-ID set for when high damage is the main objective.  I also wear a Lab CC-ID set in most circumstances for the extra HP/Regen when solo. Weapons Staff Higher Damage, and higher MND stats.  I am aiming to put 3% damage reinforcements on my staff, as at lv65+, this will be fairly impressive melee damage also. Wand & Magic Shield Defense Bonus Generally higher INT stats. More space to add reinforcements/stat slots on gear itself.

Regardless of whether you're in Turba or Crescent, once you reach level 10, you have to complete a string of quests to get your 1st job.  Accomplish this by talking to the Temperion DNA Manager (known as Damon in Rondel, Crescent and Zio in Kurt, Turba) and complete the subsequent quests.  Once you have completed them, go talk to the Temperion Master, change your job, and accept your three Skill Points. How do I make my weapon glow? That is done via item reinforcement. Compounding alone does not cause the glow effect. Information on compounding and reinforcement can be found here . GamePlay Where are the Mutant Sea Lions and/or the Krebiz? Similar to how Nightmare monsters appear only at certain hours, some monsters are daytime(5:00 ~ 19:00) monsters and therefore don't spawn during night. Where are the Desert Ant Larva? Found by activating small mounds around Sand Hell in Turba near North Watchtower How come my experience is different from others? At the current moment, those users on basic and premium plans earn more experience not only on monsters but on quests as well. I get a message about some Internet cafe expiring. What is that? This message indicates your basic/premium membership is about to expire. Note: The timing of it is a bit off, so it may give you a \"5 minute\" notification for about half an hour >.< I see people riding on some kind of animal. How do I get one? They are riding a type of mount. There are currently two ways to get one. The first is via the Item Shop, but you will have to pay real money for them. The second is to do the quest called \" Lost Rex Cage \" at level 30,if you finished the quest you can buy a Rex (50.000 Lant). The Cash shop mounts are faster than the Rex, but also have time limits. So far the Rex, from the in game quest, has no such limit. I want to choose a job for my Kruxena in Crescent, but I can't find the purple portal crystals for the quest! Where are they? The quests suggests that the crystals are to be found due east of Rondel. The crystals are actually \"southeast\" of Rondel, rather than directly eastward. I have a quest that asks for Mini Golem Claw. I've been killing golems for HOURS and haven't gotten one claw! why!? This quest is bugged. You need \"Mini Gropie Claws\", from \"Wild Small Gropies\". You can find them by the Blackhand Debouchment in Crescent and in the El-rima Desert in Turba. I'm looking for Jeff in El-rima Prison but I can't find him! This quest is bugged. His name is Jaff and he is to be found close to the Prison gate near the fireplace. Technical Issues How do I get official support for Technical Issues with Requiem? Navigate your Web Browser to [www.support.playrequiem.com www.support.playrequiem.com] where you can submit a ticket requesting support. When I start Requiem:Bloodymare, the Updater does not show any progress and then I get an error 6 message 'Failed to connect to Internet' That sometimes happens when the servers are down for testing or implementing new content. Otherwise it means your computer simply does not have an available Internet connection, or that a firewall of some sort is getting in the way. The problem can also be directed at your Internet Service Provider (ISP). It involves the path your ISP uses to get to the Requiem site and its servers. In that case, it's a waiting game and there's not much you can do about it, other then complain directly to your ISP and hope enough people do the same. I get horrible lag in the game, and other people seem to move faster than me. What's going on? This could be do to quite a few issues. From not having enough RAM on your computer, to the area you are in just being laggy period. Some places such as \"the instance\" for party quest sections have lag regardless. If you are having overall game lag, try and check your graphics card. In some cases, it may be trying to give the game rules in which it can't handle. Search the manufacturers website for your graphics card manual. If your card has options to \"Allow The Application To Control\" particular settings, try making those changes. If this does not help or you are not comfortable changing settings on your PC, try contacting the Requiem support team. They may have a host of other options for you to try.

There are no lv 70+ items yet. But i assume lv 70-90 items are Rare. And lv 90+ items will be Carus grade. on lv 30 there's 2 different type of weapons and armors. One is Ordinary, and one is Supernus. (Accel and Ferus weapons) or (fox and wolf leather armors) the supernus items have a bit higher attack or defense than the ordinary item of same level. On lv 50 its the same, there's Thunder(supernus) and Fissure(eximius) weapons. On lv 70 there will probably be a eximius and rare grade version of items too) Grades higher than Etc have a couple features that set them apart: Only the grades higher than Etc can be Compounded . Only the grades higher than Etc are eligible to contribute to \"Set Bonuses\" from Equipment Sets of the same type. Grade of Xeons Basic and Compound Xeons also have a grade.

I give all credit to their persons. This is a PVE build but would not be terribly bad as PvP with a few tweaks. I have tried this build and so far is very well thought out. It neglects the skills that become useless in higher levels. Equipment Choices Attributes and Reinforcement Str, Con, Dex, and HP should be used as reinforcements\nFor weapons, I had physical attack power xeons. Weapons Two Handed Axes Adds More Critical Damage Percent Two Handed Swords My personal favorite.  I divide the min and max attack by the speed of the weapon and tend to get the best damage per second from two handed swords.\nThe axes might be best, though, this doesn't take critical hits into account. Two Handed Bludgeons Focuses on power instead of speed. With a little MP, you can speed up attacks by spamming skills. Armor Reinforced Leather Armor until level 30 is the most economical since those levels go by very quick. At level 30, start compounding or continue using reinforced Plate Armor .

If you are very skilled, you MIGHT be able to do fine in PvP but this really isn't meant for it at all.  At lower lvl's you will win in PvP because Shaman's are overpowered but in the higher levels you will almost positively get owned if you follow this build. This build is meant to play in the backline of AoE parties.  With hp xeon reinforced armor, you might be able to solo AoE grind but higher lvl elite mobs generally tear through you. Also, this build might be difficult to level up from.  It is entirely possible but it would be best to reskill and take on this build at 60+. Equipment Choices I use a wand and magic shield and best cloth armor I can farm/afford. C-I set will make sure you barely have to sit down when grinding and will give you a ton of extra damage.  M-I set can be useful for soloing but I always prefer to kite to take minimal damage. Attributes and Reinforcement Damage Scales with int so I always reinforce my shield with int xeons, wand with magic attack power xeons, and armor with HP xeons.  You can almost double your HP reinforcing with HP 30 xeons. Weapons Wand, Magic Shield\nYou can use a staff but I prefer wand. Point Allocation Enemy Control Chaos Totem (5) - Definitely need to level this up 4 at least Loa's Curse (6) - I use this skill mostly in SL and now WS when no tank and we have to kite the boss and no one has holy bolt or kazara. pretty useful AoE Fire Totem (5) - I ran out of skills to add so i figured this one is alright for a bit of extra AoE damage.  This isn't a priority.  Add this skill after adding everything else Burning Meteor (4) - This skill has AoE stun.  Take it to 3 at least since the stun maxes at 3 sec for lvl 3 Burning Hell (7) - Great AoE skill with DoT Hellfire (1) - Sadly mystics can only take this to 1. but great skill nonetheless Soul Explosion (4) - Good AoE skill and can also be used to unstealth rogues if you are lucky Buffs Bloodlust (4) - Our only party buff really and well worth it Vindictive Mind (10) - Passive buff for more damage. Flame Shield (5) - Invest in this. One of our best skills.  I tested it against a warrior a few levels lower than me and it killed him and left me with half my hp left without ever throwing a fireball Mana Amulet (5) - In the low levels get the strengthened DNA for this.  In the higher levels after getting a C-I set, it DNA isn't needed so much Solo Attacks Fire Ball (5) - Get this.. obviously Flame Arrow (5) - It has horrible downtime but I when used like Fireball -> Flame Arrow -> Fireball, it basically gives massive DPS because the balls fire consecutively. Also has splashed damage so i guess i can throw this in AoE Fillers Home Remedy (1) Fire Rain (1) THIS BUILD LEAVES 3 POINTS UNALLOCATED BUT I CONSIDER IT FINISHED. THERE REALLY IS NOTHING WORTHWHILE TO ADD DNA Strengthened Burning Hell Strengthened Fire Ball Strengthened Flame Shield Strengthened Soul Explosion Strengthened Mana Amulet -OR- Strengthened Flame Arrow"}, {"title": "Illegal Excavation Equipment", "url": "pages/I/Illegal_Excavation_Equipment.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Illegal Excavation Equipment Requirements Level: 48 Rewards Experience: 89715 EXP Lant: 6,180 Lant 1.

Fight for your own survival against the grotesque monsters that stalk the cursed land or band together with fellow survivors to fend off the stronger, bloodthirsty creatures that awaken only at night to prey upon the weak. Use a wide selection of weapons and the mysterious powers of beast possession to viciously slay your enemies with destructive force. Requiem is set in a grim, persistent world combined with violent, blood-spattering action to provide gamers a refreshingly new and innovative approach to online game design. Game Features Nightmare Monsters Even the most experienced of players will cringe when darkness falls in the world of Requiem. The bloodthirsty Nightmare Monsters that appear at night will ravage even the strongest of parties if not well prepared for battle. Weapon Enhancements With several different item enhancement systems, players can create new items or upgrade and customize existing ones to best suit their needs. Beast Possession System Unleash the incredible power of the beast within by transforming your character into a ferocious creature. Level-up your Possesion Beast to equip it with an even deadlier selection of various skills and abilities needed to survive. PVP Prepare to battle your foes on an enormous scale. Requiem features 8-vs-8, 16-vs-16, 32-vs-32, and a colossal 96-vs-96 battlefield, where only the victorious are rewarded with special items used for obtaining the rarest of weapons and armor! DNA System Boost your character's strengths and minimize their weaknesses by reorganizing their DNA as you see fit. Having full control over their evolution leads to a wide variety of character builds sharing the same class and race. Group Zones Jump over obstacles, collect items and more needed to pass through locked areas as you venture in a group to discover what terror lies before you. These areas are designed especially for groups of players to experience an intense series of battles with high rewards. Story The original eight races left no historical records of the Ancient Era, and the only clues of the past are the relics and pictures found in the Ruins outside of Ethergia. Only four of these eight races still reside in the world of Requiem. The Ancient Era was a time of tenable peace with only minor conflicts between the eight races as alliances, rivalries, and enmities periodically shifted. This period of coexistence ended when the Nachs, creatures of the night sure of their racial superiority, waged war to conquer the humanoid races. The Nachs allied with the Ohrg, Khuns, and the demi-human Bartuks against the humanoid Turans and Xenoas. As the Turans and Xenoas struggled to defend themselves against the Nachs Alliance, the Eonay race remained neutral and avoided the conflict, choosing to invest their time and energy in developing their science. The first major shift in power during the war between the races occurred when the demi-human Bartuks suddenly betrayed the Nachs and joined the Turans and Xenoas. The loss of a major ally prompted the Nachs to create the Kruxena race, a hybrid developed from the Nachs and the few Bartuks that were loyal to them, as brutal killing machines to bolster their diminishing ranks. Meanwhile, the neutral Eonay race attained incredible power by mastering Mana manipulation with their newly developed technologies. The Natsu race was ultimately defeated by a critical mistake: they unintentionally trapped themselves in a dimensional gap when one of them touched the Noxxion, the source of the Luahn Mana that they used as power. The Kruxena, Ohrg, and Khun were swiftly and easily defeated by the Turans and Bartuks without the strength and leadership the Nachs had provided. The war ended, the Kruxenas were scattered around the world, and the Turan and Bartuk races made peace. In the following years, the Eonay race achieved the pinnacle of their prosperity by using their advanced science in Exekion, and decided to leave their home dimension to explore the unknown universe. Unfortunately, they left some remnants of their research and science behind... The Xenoa , Turan, and Bartuk races united to form the Holy Xenon Empire in the Medieval Era. During this time, the Xenoa discovered what was left of the Eonay race's science, and used their technology to usurp total control of the Holy Xenon Empire, subjugate the Turans and Bartuks, and force all of their subjects to convert to their religion and serve their god. This violation of basic freedom caused great dissent amongst the Xenoa ruling class. Political factions formed, and there were heated, frequent debates between the Liberal Party, which fought to protect the rights of Turans and Bartuks, and the tyrannical Radical Party. The Radical Party of the Holy Xenon Empire, led by Antius III ( Antius The Third ) , assumed absolute government control and declared all science as a form of paganism, and thus illegal. This horrific time in Ethergia's history is known as the Dark Age. The laws prohibiting the use of the technology and magic of the Eonay and Nachs races were enforced to prevent the Turans and Bartuks from gaining the power to overthrow their Xenoa masters. The ruling Xenoas escalated their abuse and exploitation of the Turan and Bartuk races, and when the Turans and Bartuks rebelled against their oppression, the Xenoas retaliated with a public massacre of Bartuk children. This event, now known as Bloody Tuesday, triggered the Marze War in which the Turans and Bartuks fought together against the Xenoas for their independence. The Kruxena race, which had been living in small, isolated communities, eventually joined the fight against the Xenoas. Although most Kruxenas are typically described as cold natured and cruel, they rationalized that they are genetic relatives of the Bartuk race: a slight to the Bartuks could be construed as an insult to the Kruxenas. The Turan, Bartuk, and Kruxena Alliance proved to be powerful enough for the Xenoas to desperately resort to executing the Thanatos Project, which involved combining the Luahn Mana power of the Nachs race with the science of the Eonays. This reckless gamble caused a massive explosion that tore the continent of Ethergia apart. The Thanatos tragedy is the first event recorded in the Modern Age: the explosion scattered all of the races, and it took many years for them to recover, and rebuild viable societies. The vast destruction undid centuries of progress, and reverted the standard of living for everyone that survived. The world's ecosystem suffered tremendous damage from the fallout caused by the Thanatos tragedy, and much of the world's wildlife was mutated into horrendous monsters. A new form of the Holy Xenon Empire arose in Ethergia, but its leaders decided not to follow the dictatorial rule of their predecessors. The government of this new City-State is closely tied to the Xenon religion and led by the High Priest of the Xenon Order, a former leader of the Holy Xenon Empire Liberal Party that had opposed the regime ruled by the Radical Party. Under the High Priest's leadership, the Xenon Order is working to re-establish itself as a major world religion and address the wrongs that the original Holy Xenon Empire committed in the past. The world enjoyed a period of rapid modernization with the onset of the Prosperous Era, marked by the appearance of the Ioxenic Organization and the Guildenstein Merchant Guild. The Ioxenic Organization was first sighted in Rozen City, where they supplied the city with a power station that would use Ion energy based on the dark science that the Eonay race had left behind long ago. Ion energy proved to be instrumental in industrialization, and soon became the main source of power in Ethergia. Ioxenic became a household name as they implemented new technologies to help the people, and are accredited with beginning the Prosperous Era. The Guildenstein Merchant Guild introduced wide scale trade between the continents of Ethergia, effectively re-connecting the broken fragments of the world through commerce and bolstering the world economy. The greatest menace that the races of Ethergia will face is now upon them, and future generations will know these days as the Chaotic Era. Mutant monsters continue to roam the countryside, their hordes moving closer and closer to inhabited villages and cities. Stronger, more violent Dark Creatures have begun to appear mysteriously in the night. Ioxenic has stepped forward to bring hope to the Ethergians with a surprising announcement: they will dispatch troops of finalized versions of their latest project, the enhanced humanoids they call Temperions, to protect Ethergia and defeat the growing monster threat! Most of the world is unsure of Ioxenic's motives and ultimate goals, but any of the public's doubts or suspicion of Ioxenic are quelled by Ioxenic's grand acts of altruism and technological contributions. Few people know that Ioxenic began their research to develop the Temperion prototype, code name Naothes (traveler, adventurer), to secretly continue what was started in the Thanatos Project. One of the Temperions' main directives is to find old relics left behind by the Ohrg and Khun races: Ioxenic is aware that these past artifacts will help them uncover lost science and magic that will enable their organization to attain incredible power. Ilkes, one of Ioxenic's most brilliant researchers, happened to learn Ioxenic's true agenda and escaped with a group of completed Temperions to form Fenrir Canine, a group dedicated to revealing Ioxenic's corruption and thwarting their plans. The public may see Ioxenic as saviors of the world, but what are their true intentions? What secrets could be so horrible to cause Ilkes to defect and form Fenrir Canine to oppose them? The grand fight for survival in a world plagued by darkness has just begun..."}, {"title": "Invigoration", "url": "pages/I/Invigoration.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Invigoration Skill Info Type: Supportive Skill Levels: 5 Casting Time: 1.5 sec Skill Downtime: 15.0 sec Target: Player Resistance: Elec Prerequisites First Job: Templar, Level 32, Skill Mastery 22 Advanced Job: Radiant, Level 52, Skill Mastery 42 Description Increase the target's HP Recovery for a set duration.

They are brutal and cold hearted since they are a race created for the purpose of destruction, and will even sacrifice their companions to accomplish their ends. Kruxenas have no qualms over mutilating their enemies, and tend to be antisocial. Combat Style Warrior classes use light, short range weapon to perform quick strikes, supplemented by DOT attacks. They can also use long range weapons in preemptive attacks. Magician classes use DOT magic to curse and poison enemies, but they are more vulnerable than the warrior classes. Race Relations Kruxenas were created by the ancient Natsu race to be humanoid weapons. They are unfriendly to all other races, except for Baturks since they share some of the same genes.

Your DPS simply won't be high enough before it to make it worthwhile), Secret Lab to farm your level 46 jewlery set, or AT for your Armor. Once you reach a comfortable level of 47 and 75% experiance, begin questing. If this is done with a scroll and with premium, one is able to easily quest all the way to 63/64. -- TygreNinja 11:18, 17 February 2009 (PCT)"}, {"title": "Levels", "url": "pages/L/Levels.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Overview Each character's strengths and abilities are measured by their level. A character's level begins at 1 and can increase to a maximum of 71 and 100% xp In order for a character's level to increase, they must earn Experience Points. Experience Points (\"EXP\") can be gained either through killing monsters or completing quests . EXP can be lost through character death. The amount lost scales to level and is roughly equal to 5% at level 10 and 1.5% at level 60. Character death can never lower a character's EXP to less than 0% and so will never result in the loss of a level.\nBasic accounts loose 30% less XP on death, and premium accounts loose 50% less XP on death. Each time a character gains a level, that character gains a single Skill Point which can be used to learn a new Skill or to develop a Skill already learned. Additional skill points are granted after Class Changes and upon achieving levels 30 and 60. Each level gained also increases the base Stats of a character by a set amount dependant on the character's class choice. Additionaly, a higher character level allows access to higher level equipment and quests (both of which are all character level restricted). See also: EXP Chart for the EXP requirements of each level. Skill Points or Class Changes and Awakenings below for the details of additional skill point gains. Stat Growth for tables of the exact Stat amounts gained by each class. Leveling Spots for a general guide on where to get experience to increase levels. First Job(Class) Choice At lv 10, you can advance to your first job class.\nEach race has 2 jobs they can choose at lv 10, after completing a advancement quest. Advancement from a Temperion to a First Class is a complete change in character type. Temperion Stats, Skills, Skill Points do not carry over to a character's First Class. The character's new Stats are based solely on the First Class choice. A character's Skill Points are set to 3 upon choosing their First Class. You can play as Temperion beyond level 9, but if you want to change your job at you have to do the First Choice Quest given by the Temperion DNA Manager in Rondel, if you begin in Crescent, or in Kurt if you begin in Turba. If you completed the Temperion Skill Test Quests while you are a Temperion the Temperion Skills will remain in your skill window even after you use skill reset.\nClass skills will be wiped, and you regain all skill points spent. Advanced Class Choice At level 50. You can then change your job by talking to a Temperion Master and change your Job. (You can still Level up in your first class, but your mastery´s won´t increase if you don´t change job.) An Advanced Class is a natural extension of a character's First Class choice. All First Class Stats, Skills, and spent or unspent Skill Points are retained. Additional skill choices become available in the \"2nd Job\" tab of the Skill Window. An additional 4 skill points are earned when a character chooses their Advanced Class."}, {"title": "Licht", "url": "pages/L/Licht.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Not currently implemented."}, {"title": "Life and Death", "url": "pages/L/Life_and_Death.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki"}, {"title": "Lightning Chill Slash", "url": "pages/L/Lightning_Chill_Slash.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Lightning Chill Slash Skill Info Type: Offensive Skill Levels: 5 Casting Time: Instant Cast Skill Downtime: 4.0 sec Compatible Weapon: Staff, Wand, Mace, Knuckle Range: 20.0 m Target: Enemy Prerequisites First Job: Battle Magician, Level 10, Skill Mastery 0 Description Damage a target by adding lightning and chill on a magic weapon.

Robina Mines Monsters (Level 66 - 68) Elnir Monsters (Level 60 - xx) General Information Monsters that are 15 or more levels lower than you will not attack unless provoked (confirmated). Other than that, monsters might have several kinds of aggro: groups might be linked, meaning that if you attack one all will wake up (you can often detect which monsters are linked in this way when their idle animation is synchronized.) Other monsters  might get aggro when they see you attacking something (often used for \"mothers\" attacking you when you attack a \"young\"), or they might \"call their comrades\" for help. There is still a third kind although I have seen it only once or twice. When attacking \"mother\" monsters like mother basilisk, the young basilisk may join in to attack you if there are two or more of them in close proximity. I have not had the chance to really notice the exact number, but I know for sure it is more than one. It has happened with two young basilisk in close proximity. It may have been a one off chance, but it has happened to me twice so far once with two young basilisk and three young basilisk, and I've seen this happen to other players as well. More confirmation on the third type of aggro, today I attacked a regular sized Gropie with two little ones next to it. All three started attacking me while another large Gropie nearby didn't even look twice. If you'd like to check this one out for yourself, the Gropie parent and two children are right behind (north of) the Memorial Tower in Crescent, near Valdes Village."}, {"title": "Monsters in the Cemetery", "url": "pages/M/Monsters_in_the_Cemetery.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Part 1 Monsters in the Cemetery Requirements Level: 55 Rewards Experience: 147584 EXP Lant: 8680 Lant Kill 10 Corpse Spiders around Silence Swamp"}, {"title": "Monster Appearance System", "url": "pages/M/Monster_Appearance_System.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Overview Even seasoned and strong Temperions, who no longer flinch at the sight of severed monster heads, will form a party at night to defend themselves against the heinous Nightmare Monsters that appear at night to ravage the world.

Sets can be reinforced with HP, INT, MP Recovery (Depends on your fighting style)\nBest way to grind for EXP is make a party with a Commander or Protector as tank, Radiant as healer or Tempest too. \nMany shamans take Fire Totem, but I would recommend to take Hellfire instead because it does more damage and takes only 1 Skillpoint instead of Fire Totem doing less damage for 5 Skill Points or more.\nParty Combo: Burning Hell, Fireball, Soulexplosion, Fireball, Hellfire, Fireball -> repeat and fill with Fireball.\nFlame Shield is the shamans most important Skill, you will block much more, and reflect damage if Flame Shield LvL 5 and in your DNA.\nRecommended Lab Sets for shamans: CC Lab ID and CI Lab ID\nIn party use CI, when solo CC, depends on your HP and fighting style.\nHome Remedy seems stupid for many ppl cause it only heals 8hp each 2 sec, but its really helpful. once you active the skill, sit down and your HP recovery will be 2x as fast as normal. In PvP also very good.

Certain quests must be completed before you can access major features in REQUIEM, including Job Changes, Awakenings, and Possession Monsters. NPCs will ask you to perform a variety of different tasks when you accept their quests. Sometimes you'll be performing simple deliveries, sent to talk to other NPCs, examining objects, or hunting specific monsters. Tracking Quest Progress As you carry out tasks described in quests, your progress will be clearly displayed in the center of your screen. A Quest Tracker can be displayed by clicking on the circle next to the name of a quest in your Quest Log (UI Shortcut 'U'). The names and objectives of any quests you have chosen to track will then be displayed in the Quest Tracker. The details of a quest may be examined by double clicking the name of the quest in your Quest Log or Quest Tracker. Types of Quests There are three types of quests in REQUIEM. Normal Quests Normal Quests may be obtained from any NPC. Watch for Quest Indicators above NPCs heads or on your Radar for any current or future quests available to you. Normal Quests are often part of longer quest chains. These quests generally offer the greatest rewards. Rewards for Normal Quests are redeemed from the NPC indicated in the \"Target\" section of the Quest Log upon successful quest completion. You may hold a maximum of 15 Normal Quests in your Quest Log at any one time. Scroll Quests Scroll Quests may be obtained from Quest Scroll Agents located in many towns; often in or near the town's inn. Scroll Quests do not display any Quest Indicators except on successful completion. Scroll Quests are always single quests with no follow-up. Rewards for Scroll Quests may be redeemed from any of the Quest Scroll Agents in any town. You may hold a maximum of 5 Scroll Quests in your Quest Log at any one time. Item Quests Item Quests are quests obtained from special monster dropped items that bestow quests when activated. Item Quests may or may not have follow-up quests. Rewards for Item Quests are redeemed from the NPC indicated in the \"Target\" section of the Quest Log upon successful quest completion. Item Quests are considered Normal Quests in your Quest Log and are subject to the 15 maximum Normal Quest rule. Quest Indicators Quest Indicators are REQUIEM's way of helping you judge the status of available, completed, and upcoming quests. They are displayed in the following ways: Golden Exclamation Point NPCs that have a quest available for you will display a Golden Exclamation Point above their heads. These NPCs are also represented by a Golden Circle on your Radar. Golden Question Mark NPCs who's quest(s) you have completed will display a Golden Question Mark above their heads. These NPCs are also represented by a Golden Circle on your Radar. Grey Exclamation Point NPCs with a Grey Exclamation Point above their head represent a quest who's level prerequisite you have not yet met. You will begin to see a Grey Exclamation Point when you are within 2 levels of the quest. These NPCs are also represented by a Grey Circle on your Radar. Grey Question Mark NPCs with a Grey Question Mark above their heads indicate that you have already accepted their quest(s), but haven't fulfill the quest(s) objectives yet. These NPCs are also represented by a Grey Circle on your Radar. Quest Maps These following maps provide an indication to the location of the NPC's and Monsters you will need to find while questing. Using these maps greatly assists finding items and parts needed for quests so use them often. Click an image to see the larger version!

Violations of any of these rules will result in losing the ability to create / edit and you won't get them back for a long time to come. Rules for Requiem Wiki Users Don't put in any text that is known to be false (and you know it is false too). If you honestly thought whatever info you put in was true but you don't know for 100% sure, please put a note such as (verify?) in your edits so people can help you find the fact. You are not allowed to make any sort of personal attacks on any of the pages. Do not post anything that will cause drama. All pages are supposed to be information based, not useless flame-wars / drama. Edits made should be as neutral as possible in your viewpoints. This means bias should not enter when you make edits (Example: Posting that Assassins are overpowered on the Assassin class page). Vandalism is not welcome. Don't edit things just to spite other people. Any rumors should not be posted. Absolutely no data from private servers allowed! Remember, both forums and wiki usage is a privilige, not a right. Only use English when creating pages here, as this is an English fansite. If any problems arise, you may leave the admins a message here . Suggestions that are strongly recommended Violating these won't remove your editing rights, but it is strongly suggested you follow them. We encourage users to be bold when updating pages. Wikis like ours develop faster when everybody helps to fix problems, correct grammar, add facts, make sure the wording is accurate, etc. We expect everyone to be bold and help make Requiem Wiki a better encyclopedia. rW not only allows you to add to, revise, and edit the article — it wants you to do it. It does require some amount of politeness, but it works. You will see. Also, of course, others here will edit what you write. Do not take it personally. They, like all of us, just want to make the wiki as good as it can possibly be. Also, when you see a conflict in a talk page, do not be just a \"mute spectator\". Be bold and drop your opinion there. 1. Make sure if you are working on a something with a guideline layout (such as working on classes, or skills), that it follows the existing format. This is for a conformity issue. Failure to follow this might result in your article being edited mercilessly. Deletion will only happen should it violate one of the ten rules above. 2. Make sure your page conforms with existing pages of same type, meaning, if you are working on class pages, make sure its presentation style is same as other existing types. 3. Try to follow currently existing templates for better uniformed entries. (Refer to Trans Char & Skill Pages.) 4. The article's writing style should not sound too opinionated or biased towards the writer. 5. Obviously, if your edit is minor. Please do tick the minor edit box. 6. Try to avoid phrases like \"I think\" or \"this seems\". These will be promptly removed. 7. Write pages so they are written in genderless 3rd person singular or plural instead of 2nd person singular or 1st person plural. Basically avoid \"you\" and \"we\", \"he/she\", and use \"(the) player\", etc. Example 1 Your next group of foes will be non-aggressive monsters. At first, it appears that there are only six, but they quickly multiply to about 30 or so. If you have Skill X, you can use it on three of the six groups before they can split, effectively killing about 15 monsters. The next group of foes will be non-aggressive monsters.

Please help us document the world of Requiem: Bloodymare! What is Requiem Wiki? Requiem Wiki is a website for Requiem: Bloodymare collaboratively written by many of its fans. It is a special type of website, called a wiki , that makes collecting and documenting information easy. People are constantly improving its articles with changes, all of which are recorded on article histories and recent changes. Inappropriate changes can be removed, and repeat offenders can be blocked from editing. See the FAQ for more information on the history and vision of Requiem Wiki. Editing The content on this site can be edited through any internet browser, with no additional software. For technical help on how to edit, consult any of these links: Help:Editing MediaWiki Handbook, on editing Wikipedia's editing cheatsheet Our sandbox can be used for experimental edits. Don't be afraid to edit—anyone can edit almost any page, and we encourage you to be bold! Find something that can be improved, whether it be content, grammar, or formatting, and make it better. Minor Edits help avoid clogging up the Recent Changes . Use minor edits and Show Preview when necessary. New users are encouraged to create an account so that contributions are properly attributed to them. It also makes it easier for other users to contact them. We try to follow a common style and format across articles for consistency. When editing, you can generally look at a similar article for an example or consult the other users . You can't break Requiem Wiki (but please, don't try to). Anything can be fixed or improved later. So go ahead, edit an article and help make this the best source of information on Requiem: Bloodymare! When editing an article, if your changes are only limited to a small section, it is a best practice to use the edit link of the enclosing section. If your changes involve several different sections, consider using the edit link at the top of the page instead of editing one section at a time. Also, before saving your changes, always verify them with the preview button before committing your changes. Finding something to help with As a relatively new wiki, we are still missing some articles. If you find a subject that needs an article, you can add some basic information and create it (it doesn't have to be complete!). See the list of wanted pages for pages that are linked to, but have not yet been created. Some articles have only basic information and need to be filled out -- these are known as \"stubs\". To find and help with these, look through Category:Stubs . Although they are no longer \"stubs\", some articles still have sections that are very short -- known as \"stub sections\". They can be found at Category:Articles with stub sections . To join or start a focused effort on improving specific areas of the wiki, see RWiki:Projects . Some users like to browse pages at random to find articles to improve. Use the \"Random page\" link in the side navigation box. Many others prefer to help with current problems and conflicts, which can be found in the list of recent changes . See also For a list of this wiki's policies, see RWiki:Conduct .

Looking for more information It seems that many articles here were written when Requiem was in the beta stages. This leads to some confusing information, such as blank pages under Items -> Posession beasts, as well as Items Unimplemented weapons. As for the weapons, a couple of the pages suggest future developments, but were these developments canceled in the beta stage or can we expect a Requiem version 4.5 or even version 5?

You want to see the end of destruction? Ok, I'll show you the end!\" Description While technically not a dungeon, Ruinhorn's Lair (found at the spot on the Numaren map denoted as \"Ruinhorn's Lair\") is the first of two high-level raids in Requiem. Inside the instance of the Lair is a small arena and a lone egg. The egg itself summons the raid boss, Ruinhorn , a giant black dragon of immense power, and immense riches. See Ruinhorn for more information. Anger of Ruinhorn , Poison of Ruinhorn , Spite of Ruinhorn , and Sublimity of Ruinhorn armor, as well as unique Ruinhorn Weapons and Reinforcement Xeons can drop from Ruinhorn , as well as 50+ weapons, armor and xeons of random quality. Entry Requirements The raid requires an alliance party of at least 16 members (can include more)[now need 4 Players to enter but need more to survive at Ruinhorn]. The team does not necessarily have to be entirely made up of level 55+ players, but only level 55+ players can enter the instance and face Ruinhorn. When the team is assembled and ready inside the instance, one of the players must right click and 'activate' the egg, which will summon Ruinhorn , a level ?? raid boss. Upon defeating Ruinhorn, the team will be tagged by a Raid Info marker. This marker means you cannot enter the instance again for another 24 hours, although you may join alliance parties as 'filler' for players that haven't yet killed Ruinhorn that day, even though you cannot physically enter and face Ruinhorn yourself."}, {"title": "Ruinhorn's Twisted Claw", "url": "pages/R/Ruinhorn_s_Twisted_Claw.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki"}, {"title": "Ruinhorn's Twisted Crossbow", "url": "pages/R/Ruinhorn_s_Twisted_Crossbow.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki"}, {"title": "Ruinhorn's Twisted Dual Sword", "url": "pages/R/Ruinhorn_s_Twisted_Dual_Sword.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki"}, {"title": "Ruinhorn's Twisted Knuckles", "url": "pages/R/Ruinhorn_s_Twisted_Knuckles.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki"}, {"title": "Ruinhorn's Twisted Shield", "url": "pages/R/Ruinhorn_s_Twisted_Shield.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki"}, {"title": "Ruinhorn's Twisted Staff", "url": "pages/R/Ruinhorn_s_Twisted_Staff.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki"}, {"title": "Ruinhorn's Twisted Sword", "url": "pages/R/Ruinhorn_s_Twisted_Sword.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki"}, {"title": "Ruinhorn", "url": "pages/R/Ruinhorn.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Ruinhorn Location(s) Numaren Affiliation Hostile Type Raid ( boss ) Level(s) Unknown Ruinhorn is a giant black dragon of immense power. Ruinhorn is summoned from Ruinhorn's Lair in Numaren . Ruinhorn is the first raid boss encountered in Requiem. Skills Paralysis Ruinhorn will regularly cast Paralysis on whoever he is currently targeting. Paralysis will reduce the movement speed of the target by 50% for 5 seconds. Mashing Ruinhorn will use this attack fairly regularly. It, like all skills, goes through player defense for devastating damage (around 1700 on a level 57 Protector). Dark Breath Ruinhorn, like any typified dragon, has a breath attack, which hits in a small area around him (it can be avoided by staying away from his hurtbox, which is quite large, and behind him) as well as a longer range directly forward. Even though it can be avoided, it can be difficult to do so because of lag. This attack can do well upwards of 1500 damage depending on level and resistance. Melee Swing Ruinhorn's basic attack can do around 900 damage to a level 57 Protector. Wind of Edge 30m range PBAoE. Can do upwards of 1000 damage. Considering the small size of the arena, it is hard to avoid. Earthshock 30m range PBAoE stun. Stuns for 5 seconds, deals 1500-2200 damage, can be difficult to avoid. Summon Ghoul Ruinhorn will summon an elite ghoul mob, which will proceed to attack a nearby target. They are fairly strong and tough, but can be taken down rather quickly by a couple of players. Ruinhorn will summon these regularly, so leaving them alive for long is not an option. With update 1.8.09:RuinHorn's Ghoul of Ruin no longer cause paralysis,\n Ghoul of Ruin HP is doubled. Ruinhorn's Patterns Ruinhorn has some set patterns to his attacks, and some weird properties to how he prioritizes these patterns. He will begin by casting Paralysis, Mashing, and Dark Breath. Mashing can be avoided by a kiting tank, and, if not slowed by Paralysis, can sometimes avoid Dark Breath also. Paralysis has a long range and is difficult to avoid because of its quick cast time. When Ruinhorn takes about 1/4 to 1/3 of his HP in damage, he will change tactics. He will continue to cast Paralysis and Mashing, but will forgot Dark Breath and replace it with Wind of Edge and Earthshock. As both Wind of Edge and Earthshock are PBAoE's, they cannot be avoided by a kiting tank unless they run well out of range in the cast time of the skills, which can be difficult, especially if under Paralysis. Upon hitting around 1/3 to 1/4 of his health, Ruinhorn will change tactics again. He will start to summon Ghouls regularly, and resume using Dark Breath in place of Wind of Edge. In some cases he will use Earthshock at this HP level, but rarely. Ruinhorn also seems to prioritize his skills based on how fast or how slow he is taking damage. A party killing him very quickly seems to abide by the above rules, but a party having alot of trouble with him and killing him rather slowly may have different patterns, such as having Ruinhorn not cast Ghouls until about 5-10% of his HP is remaining, rather than 1/3 - 1/4. The range of his skills, especially AoE's, can sometimes differ as well. Now he runs to the group behind and attack them- he can kill fastly lot of people. Fastly a tank must control him and stop him walking. NOTES : Ruinhorn is immune to slows, sleep, stun etc. Drops Ruinhorn will drop many items for the raid party that defeats him. In addition to level 50+ equipment and xeons of random quality, Ruinhorn also drops sets of armor, as well as unique weapons and reinforcement xeons.

However, the Kuns lost the war between the Races, and their city crashed to the ground: what is left is now known as the Ruins of Lament. The ruins have slowly begun to erode and become buried by the passage of time. Description Ruins of Lament is an instanced dungeon. Each instance is reserved for one party. The instance will reset after all players have exited. Monsters inside this dungeon do not respawn. Frezia and Khrentium armor and compound xeons can drop from any of the monsters in this dungeon. Lamenting Cry and Lamenting Sound armor can drop from the bosses in this dungeon. There are five bosses to this dungeon, however only the last two drop Lamenting armor. The first boss is in the initial room, guarded by two mobs, and drops a Heart of Lamentation. The second boss, drops a key to one of 3 rooms to the fourth boss. The third boss is optional (actually the easiest monster in the dungeon).  Defeating him completes a part of the Forgotten Relics quest, necessary to obtain one's Possession Beast. The fourth boss will cast a spell on one target to regain HP when low.  With enough damage being dealt, you'll hardly see this spell being used at all.  He is susceptible to sleep only occasionally (need to check, but usually my first sleep hits, all following fail).  This boss drops an Organ Key, which when used on the organ in the center of the dungeon, reveals a short cutscene. The final boss is located in one of 3 rooms on the upper levels.  One must cross a bridge which appears after the cutscene to get there.  He uses a stun attack which lasts a few seconds in addition to normal attacks. Note that if any of the keys are not retrieved before they vanish, the party can not continue through the dungeon.  Also, if you leave the dungeon without using a key, the key remains in your inventory and can be used during a different run.  The keys are untradable.

The same skill cannot be entered into the queue more than once. Only skills which are not locked out from \"skill downtime\" can be queued. Once a skill has been queued, it's order in the queue cannot be changed. Skills in the queue are represented by a flashing icon. To queue a skill for activation, simply press it's skill icon or the shortcut key you assign it to (by clicking and dragging the skill's icon from the skill panel into the quick slot bar at the bottom of the UI.) Skill Use Phases Skill use is divided into the following phases: Skill Activated Skill activation occurs when a skill in the queue reaches the top of the skill queue. The unmodified MP consumption and other costs are checked (but not yet subtracted) to see if the character meets the costs of the skill. This initial cost check does not take into account the effects of DNA or any other cost reduction modifiers. If the character cannot meet these costs the skill will not take effect. All melee skills and some ranged and magic skills will also check for line of sight in this step. A failed line of sight check means the skill will not take effect. Casting Time Casting Time is represented by the player's HP bar changing from the character's name to the name of the skill. A golden line will flow from left to right on the bar and when the line reaches the end, the casting time is completed. An instant cast skill will not show this effect. During casting time the character cannot attack or use other skills. Character movement during the casting time results in the cancelation of the skill (although a character can turn while casting.) Instant cast skills are not affected by movement; (can be cast while your character is moving.) Autoattack Synchronization This phase only applies to melee or ranged weapon skills. The next skill phase is delayed until the the next time the character would perform an autoattack. The skill then takes the place of the autoattack in the next phase. Skill Effects Applied Any skill that makes line of sight checks will again check for line of sight in this phase. A failed line of sight check means the skill will not take effect. The skill MP consumption and other costs are reduced by any cost reducing effects, such as DNA, and the final cost is paid. The skill effects then take place. Animation Delay Some skills have an animation that continues after the skill's effects have already been applied. During this time, no other skills can be activated and the character cannot attack. Skill Downtime The skill is locked out from use for a duration equal to it's skill downtime. This is represented by the icon being greyed out and the time until the skill is ready for use being displayed on the skill icon."}, {"title": "Skill Mastery", "url": "pages/S/Skill_Mastery.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Skill Mastery is the total number of skill points you have spent on all your skills.

There are four attacking, and one illusion which basically acts as a meat shield.  Summons are very useful in Higher end PvE, but can be a pain to control at times.  This page will hopefully help with that. Summon Kazara - Melee Attack (Available to Defiler). Skinned as Jumping Zombie Battle Form.  Uses Paralyse skill. Good use as tank. Summon Lenatore - Ranged Attack (Available to Defiler). Skinned as Goblin Hunter.  Shoots Arrows.  Useful for taking a 2nd target of you Summon Nastech - Magic Attack.  Skinned as Arioch NM creature.  Uses Firepole skill.  DPS Summon Ennon - Magic Attack.  Skinned as Goblin Healer.  Heals and uses Fireball skill. DPS Summon Illusion - A copy of your Character, no attack (Available to Defiler).  Meatshield Controls Name Bars Controls Each Summon comes with its own Name Bar, and a Control bar.  The Control bar is the same for each Summon, but if you click on the Summon Name, the Control bar shows the current setting for that Summon. Even the Illusion will have a bar, although whatever setting it is on, it will just stand there and do nothing but be a distraction to the foe. Pre-emptive Attack Under this setting, your Summons will automatically attack any target that comes within range.  However, you can still use the attack and retreat options while set as Pre-emptive. This setting can get a little messy especially if your in an area that is highly populated with foes. This setting can be very useful for finding a one spawn spot, and leaving the Summons to attack while you're afk.  Be sure to watch on the 1st target though to make sure they are actually attacking, and that they can take down the foe without you. Defense Summons will only attack anything that attacks you.  Once the 1st hit has been made on you, they will auto attack that foe.  However, you can still send them to fight by using the Target Nearest / Attack method described in Manual Operation, but in Defense mode, they will only respond to foes with melee attack range. Manual Operation In my opinion, this is a safer way of using your Summons.  They wont attack anything or anyone unless you command them to, using the command bar.  The easiest way to do this is set a key to \"Target Nearest\" and another key to \"Attack\".  When you want to start fighting, click on the 1st Summon, then press Target and Attack, and move to the 2nd Summon, and so on.  They will all then move in on the foe and kill it, usually without you taking any aggro. Pulling Even though this class has a Range attack, pulling beyond the range of this attack without gaining any aggro is very easy.  Select the Summon, (I usually use Kazara) then click on the target foe.  Use the Control Bar to set the Kazara to Attack.  He will then run off toward the foe, even if it is way beyond your Skill Range.  Will not work in Defense Mode. Once the Kazara has got its 1st hit in, click on the Kazara Name bar again, and Retreat it using the Control Bar.  Both your Summon and the foe will then come to you.  Once within targeting range, set the other Summons on it, and you can kill this target usually without gaining any aggro. Known Problems If the Lenatore gains aggro, it runs away to try and gain range, taking the foe and all your minions with it.  The best way to deal with this is always send in the Kazara 1st. Summons attacking other players.  Not sure why this happens, it could be due to clicking the cursor on a player instead of a foe, as things can get a little hectic on screen, but they will attack a Party member, and even a Guild Member if told to do so.  If this happens, quickly select the Summon and Retreat it. If you use Return, all your Summons Name bars will sometimes dissappear, making it impossible to change thier setting.  You will need to re-summon. (under testing by Gravity) If you jump down a cliff face, the active summons may get confused and appear to be running constantly.  If this happens, it has been noted that an attacking foe will target you rather than your illusion.  Re-summoning is the best solution. Involuntary Murderer.  If a low lvl player or a bot decides to start on your Summons, they will fight back if set on attack, and will generally win, making you into a murderer against your will.  I find this to be a flaw, but it does happen. If you are in the middle of killing a mob when another spawns on you, or within range of targeting you.  Once the pets have killed the 1st mob, they do not always attack the second mob.  There appears to be a delay between end of combat, and registering a new target. If you cast a Summon, then use any HP potion while it is casting, the Summon will fail to cast."}, {"title": "Summon Ennon", "url": "pages/S/Summon_Ennon.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Summon Ennon Skill Info Type: Active Skill Levels: 5 MP Consumption: 152 Casting Time: 5.0 Seconds Skill Downtime: 8.1 Seconds Range: N/A Target: N/A Prerequisites Advanced Job: Dominator, Level 50, Skill Mastery 40 Description Summon Ennon, a familiar specializing in healing its master and other familiars, for a set duration.

While the majority of monsters seem to give the same amount of exp per level, some were clearly giving less or more than they should. I think what may be happening is that certain monsters have a hidden internal level that may be different from their displayed level in game. Level 40 and 39 elite goblin healers in parness, for example, give exp equal to an elite monster exactly 1 level below them. Perhaps the other inconsistencies can be explained in this way as well. I think the rest of this chart is a good resource and I'd like to see it incorporated back into the main article. I think the best way to do that would be to note any inconsistencies with particular mobs as long as we can show that they do have a hidden level. I've moved the parts of the table here that were removed from the main article. We can continue to make additions here so that we can compare data. If too many inconsistencies are discovered I'll concede to scrapping the project. Keep in mind any additions to this table should be recorded while not in a party and with monsters -1 to +4 levels of your character as shown on the main article. Please list any inconsistencies at the bottom of the table . -- Redruin 14:12, 26 April 2008 (MDT) Thinking about it I've come up with a possible solution that would get around this problem altogether.  Perhaps we could instead implement the EXP monsters give into the pages about the monsters themselves?  In my opinion, the Monsters section needs to be completely redone, and I'm still thinking of ways to make it feel less clumsy.  But in the meantime, perhaps we could add a field to the Monster tables that specifies the amount of EXP given from defeating that mob? Example of enemy with multiple levels: Picture Name Level EXP Reward Skill(s) Location Spear Reindeer 1 29 - Fridha Snowfields Rondel Basin 2 39 3 52 4 64 Example of enemy with one level: Picture Name Level EXP Reward Skill(s) Location Putrid Wild Dog 10 141 - Fridha Snowfields This way any monsters with \"irregular\" EXP rewards can still have their data shown without any conflictions with any EXP tables. -- Noir 16:27, April 28, 2008 (EDT) I think that depends a lot on how the monster pages end up being formated. If they end up each getting their own page, then I think a table in one spot would be better for comparing exp amounts. However, if they stay on the same pages then it would be fine. I don't really see a need to give them each a seperate page atm, since mobs don't tend to have anything that really sets them apart from each other aside from the occassional skill they use. Keep in mind that if you add row or column spans to a table, that that table can no longer be sortable as far as I know. -- Redruin 15:58, 28 April 2008 (MDT) Monster EXP by Level Level Normal Mob's Experience Elite Mob's Experience Nightmare Mob's Experience 1 29 - - 2 39 - - 3 52 - - 4 64 - - 5 76 - - 6 90 - - 7 101 - - 8 113 - - 9 128 - - 10 141 - - 11 152 - 350 12 165 - - 13 179 - 413 14 194 - - 15 209 - - 16 - - - 17 - - - 18 - - - 19 - - - 20 - - - 21 - - - 22 - - - 23 - - - 24 - - - 25 - - - 26 - - - 27 - - - 28 - - - 29 - - - 30 - - - 31 - - - 32 - - - 33 - - - 34 - - - 35 - - - 36 - - - 37 - - - 38 - - - 39 - - - 40 - - - 41 - - - 42 - - - 43 - - - 44 - 2416 - 45 - - - 46 - - - 47 - - - 48 - - - 49 - - - 50 - - - 51 - - - 52 - - - 53 - - - 54 - - - 55 1093 3280 4373 56 1121 3363 4484 57 1151 3453 4603 58 1180 3541 - 59 1210 3631 - 60 1240 3719 - 61 1273 3818 - 62 1304 3911 - Inconsistencies 39 and 40 elite Goblin Healers in Parness were giving exp for level 38 and 39 elite monsters, respectively. 23 elite Libeshal awards 718 EXP ( Mob | Combat Award ), 23 elite Khayentou awards 825 EXP( Mob | Comabt Award )."}, {"title": "Talk:Giont Armor", "url": "pages/T/Talk_Giont_Armor.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Future Icons Icons for the pieces higher than 60.

Afterwards I will enter in what data I have at my disposal. Noir 22:01 May 21, 2008 (EDT) Weapons In regards to the base damage listed for the earlier weapons... Some weapons offer multiple grades.  For example, a Dull Claw can be both Etc. Grade and Ordinary Grade.  The difference in grade also reflects a difference in base damage, but only one damage (and one grade) is listed for each weapon.  Entries should be edited to reflect this information, perhaps like this: Icon Name Grade Base Damage Base Critical Level Mastery Notes Dull Claw Etc. ?? - ?? ??% 10 Claw 1 - Dull Claw Ordinary 12.0 - 15.0 5.20% 10 Claw 1 - Or in a manner where the fields with multiple values can display all values in one field.  My knowledge of wiki editing is limited so I wouldn't know how to accomplish that. Also, this issue will hold true for armors as well, as some armors that can come in multiple grades will have different defense values for each grade.  -- Noir 16:57, April 25, 2008 (EDT) Edited out my last comment: Well, on reflection, I suppose having all the information would be best. This would work, I think: Icon Name Grade Base Damage Base Critical Level Mastery Notes Dull Claw Etc. 10 Claw 1 - Ordinary 12.0 - 15.0 5.20% -- Redruin 15:43, 25 April 2008 (MDT) I begun making the format changes for the weapons pages.  I wasn't 100% sure if the Eximus grade weapons had an Etc. counterpart or not, added the space for them if they do otherwise they can be edited out.  Unfortunately as my only game access was the international version I am unable to obtain any of the damage numbers for the Etc. weapons until open beta begins again.  Thinking ahead there will probably be cause for additional format changes when we consider adding in the effects of compounding equipment to higher levels. Also thank you Redruin, that was precisely the format I was thinking but didn't know how to code.  -- Noir 19:34, April 25, 2008 (EDT) Armor I moved the armors from individual slot pages (head, chest) to armor type pages (cloth, leather). Since each slot offers the same defense value, I felt that the individual slot pages offered a lot of redundant information. I'm not sure about the 5 images per armor set though. It seems like it might be too much. -- Redruin 20:15, 24 April 2008 (MDT) I'm not sure I like the page breaks in the icons. They should bunch up like that with smaller resolutions anyway. -- Redruin 21:39, 25 April 2008 (MDT) Point taken, I didn't consider the effects of varying resolutions.  I'll undo the page breaks for now while an alternate solution is thought of. -- Noir 23:46, April 25, 2008 (EDT) How does this look?

My ingame name is XLeviathonX and i dont mind writing a fair deal of backstory etc. \n-- XleviathanX 09:17, 23 May 2008 (MDT) My little Review of Open Beta version The character graphics are better then Lord of the Rings online, Guild Wars and certain as World of Warcraft (only AoC could beats the graphics of Requiem till now) and they're still updating the enviroment to make it more living. They intoduced new inviroments like snow storm and a frequent dynamic day/night system for more variation. When you start playing the game you need to get used to the graphics, but when you play for a longer time and explore new content(after around 3-4 hours), you will start liking them. The game world is also increasing and is now around 2x the size world of warcraft (with BC expansion). The gameplay realy rocks and is very exciting. Also the 4th race will be added in korea this month and will be introduced a few weeks after this in the European version. The sound is fresh and has lots of diffrent themes, but it needs a bit more variation from time to time. Its free and the Open Beta is current running. The 3rd server you could chose is a PK server but noone is playing there cause Player kill servers aren't that loved :P. The first server is realy busy at the other hand, but the community is very helpful and friendly so this isn't any problem. At the official release this game will still be free and will not have a monthly fee to pay and will be at 19/06/2008 (the closed beta ends 12/06/2008). The only few things that they realy have to improve is the quest text or add a location tracker like guild wars has, balance the servers more cause around 1x every 2 hours you are kicked of the server and add Anisotrophic, cause now you need to enable this in control panel and with it the game looks lots better (I tried it with 16x Anisotrophic and with off the only main thing is that you need at least the recommended system requirements to enable this, if you don't want to get a bad framerate). Nots till now: * Gameplay: 7.4 (the graphics will be updated with the official version, cause in open beta only low graphics are available)\n   * Graphics: 8.8\n   * Sound: 7.8\n   * Community:9.1 (everyone is very helpful and kind) (tested on a 4200+, 2gb ddr800, 7900gtx 512mb). Greetz Robertjanvaneijk1988 (talk) 10:27, 5 June 2008 (UTC) To anybody who knows ...such as Robertjanvaneijk1988, who was a part of the Beta testing- there are Unimplemented Weapons in the Items page. Do you know if these are current future plans, or if they were plans canceled in the beta stage?"}, {"title": "Talk:Monsters", "url": "pages/T/Talk_Monsters.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Format Anyone have any ideas for formating this section? Things to include per monster: Name, Level(s), Skills, Location Aggressive: Yes / No Normal / Elite / Nightmare / Boss Exp and Lant per level Spawn cycle: Normal / Daytime / Nightmare / None Any special drops: Quest starters / Set gear / Boss drops Anything else? Each map and submap (dungeon) should be divided into their own pages. Obviously there's a lot of mobs in each of the overworld maps. If we start to incorporate a lot of information for each mob, the tables could get pretty crowded and perhaps unsortable. I'm thinking seperate pages for each mob would be the way to go. I suppose linking through categories would be the easiest to set-up and maintain. Anyone else have any feedback? -- Redruin 23:38, 28 April 2008 (MDT) The way I see it, since a wiki is not built to be the kind of raw database that's really needed to display this type of info, there's no way around it other than cramming too much info for them.  Seeing as Requiem doesn't currently have a database like Ragnarok does, I guess I can't really go against doing it that way, but I don't really like having 1 page/monster since the scope is just enormous, and you better make sure each page is categorized lest you \"forget\" about some of them. -- Resplendent 10:26, 29 April 2008 (MDT) I agree, I kind of like the monsters in a list as they are.  But there is just too much information that needs to be displayed for each monster for it to work out.  Maybe a sort of compromise could be possible?  Have the monsters in a sortable table with some basic information, and then clicking the monster entry's name and/or picture would link to more detailed information.  It sounds good in theory.  If that doesn't work then I think I'd stand by Redruin's suggestion of separate pages.  -- Noir 18:36, April 29, 2008 (EDT) Just another note I wouldn't add ANYTHING new about monsters until OB.  Lord knows the whole wiki will probably be instantly outdated once it starts. -- Resplendent 07:51, 30 April 2008 (MDT) I've added a section for all the dungeon monsters ( since these are all elite and have different lvl ranges than their outside counterparts. I also started to plug in monsters for parness. Most of them are listed under daytime mobs as i think we should not break it down so much. Maybe only categorize them as Normal and Nightmare, then on the normal side of things have columns to denote elite or daytime only."}, {"title": "Talk:Plate Armor", "url": "pages/T/Talk_Plate_Armor.html", "content": "From Requiem Wiki Renamed Guardian to Fearless.

A character choosing a First Class will shed all skills and restrictions previously held as a Temperion and acquire those of their chosen First Class.

They are a rational race that upholds justice, preferring balanced and harmonized combat styles, quick movements, and agility over the use of brute force. They are also adept at learning the other races' abilities, adapting the divine magic of the Xenoas for their own use. Combat Style Turans are mediocre in terms of strength and spirit, but they excel in agility, learning, and intelligence. These qualities enable them to learn and utilize a great variety of skills. They are a highly moral race, so Turans tend to use humane skills that do not unnecessarily torture their enemies in battle. Race Relations The Turan and Bartuk races utilized fighting styles dependent on skills based on physical strength early in their histories. However, the Turans eventually began to also develop a more balanced combat style since the Bartuks were much physically stronger than them. During the era of the Xenon Empire, many Turans studied divine magic and became adepts. They are naturally opposed to the dark magic wielding Kruxenas, and are weak to their magic attacks.

Through compounding the effective level of an item is increased. This translates into a chance for higher stats (STR, INT, HP Recovery, etc.) and guaranteed higher damage, physical defense, or block defense. The Level and Equipment Mastery prerequisites of an item will never go up through compounding. This means it's possible, for example, to wield the equivalent of a level 40 weapon as a level 15 character. Although compounding can be powerful, it's important to note that it is a gamble. Each time you compound an item there is a chance that you might fail and that the item will be permanently lost . It's generally good practice to have a spare piece of equipment you can fall back on should you lose the one you are attempting to compound. Only Weapons, (Magic) Shields, and Armor can be compounded. Jewelry can never be compounded. Effects of Compounding There are five upgrades available beyond the base level that all items start at. Each time an item is upgraded through compounding, the defense of armors, and attack of weapons go up. The amount varies depending on item type, and level Upgrade Fortis Amplio Melior Ulterius Potens For Example: When compounded, a Dull Wand (a level 10 item) will become a Fortis Dull Wand. When compounded again it will become an Amplio Dull Wand. Dull Crossbow has 24 attack Fortis Dull Crossbow has 30 attack (25% increase) Amplio Dull Crossbow has 35 attack (17% increase from Fortis) Amplio Dull Crossbow is a little stronger than Fides Crossbow (33 attack) Brutal Blaze Claw: 180 - 225 Fortis Brutal Blaze Claw: 194 - 245 (+8% - +9% increase) Amplio Brutal Blaze Claw: 215 - 267 (+11% - +9% increase) Melior Brutal Blaze Claw: 234 - 292 (+9% - +9% increase) The increase in Effective Level of an item results in two things: The Damage, Physical Defense, or Block Defense is increase by a set amount . This amount depends on item type (dual sword, wand, cloth armor, leather armor, etc.) and the starting level of the item. The Stats (STR, INT, etc.) assigned to an item have a higher maximum value. Although the damage and defense of an item is guaranteed to increase, the stats are randomly reassigned with the new higher maximum values and may or may not increase. For Example: A sword might have a possible STR range of 0~3. Upon entering the game world, the sword's STR is randomly assigned a value in that range. If you were to compound that sword it's STR range might then become 0~4, but upon being compounded it's STR is randomly reassigned a value in the new range. Note that compounding an item will result in the loss of previous Reinforcement Xeons applied to that item. Process of Compounding To compound an item you need the following: The Weapon or Armor to be compounded. Only items that have the [Compoundable] tag in their tooltip are eligible. One Compound Xeon . The Compound Xeon needed is determined by the name of the item and the upgrade level from which it's being compounded. For example: A Fortis Dull Wand will require a Fortis Dull Compound Xeon to be compounded to an Amplio Dull Wand. Basic Xeons of the item's Grade . The number of Basic Xeons needed increases with the Level of the item and the upgrade level from which it's being compounded (Fortis, Amplio, etc.). The type of Basic Xeon needed is the same as the item's Grade (Ordinary, Supernus, etc.). Lant . Lant cost increases with the Level of the item and the upgrade level from which it's being compounded. Compounding is conducted through an Item Compound Blacksmith NPC located in the major towns. To begin compounding right click the NPC and insert the item to be compounded into the first slot. Then chose the upgrade option from the list on the right. Then insert the Compound Xeon into the second slot, and the indicated number of Basic Xeons into the third slot. The fourth slot is thought to be reserved for cash shop coupons not yet available in REQUIEM. Take note of the \"Chance\" of success. Upon a successful compound the upgraded item will appear in your first open inventory slot. Failure results in the loss of the item and all materials involved. Reinforcing Equipment Reinforcing equipment is the process of inserting Reinforcement Xeons into Reinforcement Slots in your equipment in order to enhance particular stats. Any piece of equipment can be be reinforced; jewelry included. The number of reinforcement slots available on a particular piece of equipment is generally equal to it's level/10, rounded down (1 at 10, 1 at 15, 2 at 20, etc.). You may reinforce any combination of Reinforcement Xeons into your equipment. The only restrictions pertain to the type of Reinforcement Xeon used: Weapon Reinforcement Xeons, ,  can only be applied to weapons and no other equipment. Armor Reinforcement Xeons, , can only be applied to armor or shields and no other equipment. All other Reinforcement Xeons can be applied to any piece of equipment. Effects of Reinforcing The effects of reinforcement depends exactly on which type of Reinforcement Xeon you used. A +2 STR xeon reinforced into your helm, for example, will bestow an additional +2 STR in addition to any natural or reinforced STR already present on the helm. A weapon with at least one Reinforcement Slot filled will display a glow around the blade or head of the weapon. The color of the glow is dependent on the type of weapon according to this table: Weapon Type Glow Color Claw Purple Crossbow Red Dual Sword Amber One or Two Handed Axe Blue One or Two Handed Bludgeon Blue One or Two Handed Sword Red Staff Turquiose Wand Turquiose A weapon with 4 or more Reinforcement Slots filled will display a glowing rune around the weapon's hilt. The rune differs according to the number of filled slots, and weapon type. A weapon with 6 Reinforcement Slots filled will display a larger, more elaborate glowing rune around the weapon. It is important to note that if you later compound an already reinforced item, all previous reinforcements on that item will be lost. Process of Reinforcing To reinforce an item you need the following: The Piece of Equipment to be reinforced. Only items that have an available Reinforcement Slot are eligible. One Reinforcement Xeon . Only one Reinforcement Xeon may be applied to an item at a time. Basic Xeons of the item's Grade . The number of Basic Xeons needed increases with the level of the item. The type of Basic Xeon needed is the same as the item's Grade (Ordinary, Supernus, etc.). Lant . Lant cost increases with the level of the item. Reinforcing is conducted through an Item Reinforcement Blacksmith NPC located in the major towns. To begin reinforcing right click the NPC and choose the \"Reinforce Item\" option. Insert the item to be reinforced into the first slot. Then insert the Reinforcement Xeon into the second slot, and the indicated number of Basic Xeons into the third slot. Take note of the \"Chance\" of success. After a successful or failed reinforcement the item will appear in your first open inventory slot. Regardless of whether a reinforcement succeeds or fails, the slot you used for that reinforcement will be expended. A failed result will read, for example, \"0/1(-1)\" if the item initially had 0/2 Reinforcement Slots and now has one failed reinforcement attempt. Unlike compounding, reinforcing an item can never result in the loss of that item. Compounding Reinforcement Xeons Reinforcement Xeons can be compounded to increase the bonuses they apply when reinforced into your weapons or armor. To do so requires any 2 compoundable Reinforcement Xeons, 14 Basic Xeons, and some Lant. The compounding is conducted at an Item Compound Blacksmith NPC. Success chance is \"Average\". Failure results in the loss of all materials. Only xeons that reinforce the same piece of equipment (i.e. armor or weapon) are eligible to be compounded together. Previously compounded Reinforcement Xeons cannot be compounded further. When compounding xeons together, the order in which they are inserted into the Compounding Window will determine what sort of xeon you end up with. The primary slot and will always bestow it's full effects on the final compounded xeon. The second slot will bestow roughly one third to one half of it's effects on the final compounded xeon, depending on the particular xeon used. This table shows the results of compounded Reinforcement Xeons when used in the secondary slot of the Compounding Window. Reinforcement Xeon Secondary Slot Results STR: +3 STR: +2 +1 DEX: +3 DEX: +2 +1 INT: +3 INT: +2 +1 CON: +3 CON: +2 +1 MND: +3 MND: +2 +1 HP: +30 HP: +20 +10 MP: +25 MP: +15 +5 HP Recovery: +3 HP Recovery: +2 +1 MP Recovery: +2 MP Recovery: +1 +1 Accuracy: +40 Accuracy: +30 +10 Critical Chance: +0.40% Critical Chance: +0.30% +0.10% Damage: +4.0 Damage: +3.0 +1.0 Evasion: +40 Evasion: +30 +10 Physical Defense: +15 Physical Defense: +10 +5 Example 1: A +2 INT xeon in the primary slot and a +15 MP xeon in the secondary slot will produce a Reinforcement Xeon that gives +2 INT and +5 MP. Example 2: A +30 Accuracy xeon in the primary slot and a +30 Accuracy Xeon in the secondary slot will produce a Reinforcement Xeon that gives +40 Accuracy. Compounding Basic Xeons Basic Xeons can be compounded to increase their Grade to the next highest grade. To do so requires any 20 Basic Xeons of the same grade and some Lant. The chance of success and Lant costs increase with the grade from which you are compounding. Basic Xeon compounding is conducted at an Item Compound Blacksmith NPC. Insert 10 Basic Xeons into the primary slot and 10 Basic Xeons of the same grade into the secondary slot. Success yields 10 Basic Xeons of the next highest grade.

The only exceptions to this is if the users image does not work properly (ie. broken link), isnt formatted correctly (i.e should be an image and not a link), or if the game is updated in a way in which the old image is obselete (ie. They made a new part of the armor visible, etc). Otherwise, if you feel an additional image is needed, please add it to our graphics light version. 2. Please try and keep images small enough to prevent page stretching. If you wish to keep a large file, please create a thumbnail view.( When all images are finally in place some formatting might occur in order to keep the page in \"order\") 3. If you can please provide a sheathed and unsheathed view. More views are great as well. 4. As much as possible, use images of weapons that doesn't have glows (unreinforced) 5.

Ru Burun was a huge ship that was 108 meters long and could carry up to 600 people. Its huge size makes it look like a small city. During the disaster of Thanatos, the chaos caused Ru Burun to crash. The archaeologists that are interested in the lost civilization of Zudeka, in particularly the Ioxeinc, are sparing no effort in finding and using the old civilization to operate Thanatos again. For them, the remains of Ru Burun may lead to some great discoveries leading to Thanatos once again. The Upper and Central sections of the Ru Burun, which were thought to hold the information they seeked, were blocked. So they decided to begin the excavation starting from the lower part of the Ru Burun which had sunk into the depths of the sea. Upon entering the lower part of the ship, they had to face monsters and the spirits of the lost crew of the Ru Burun who had lost their self-control.
