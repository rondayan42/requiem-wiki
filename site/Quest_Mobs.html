<p>Here are some common sought after locations. When you add one please try to avoid using specific coordinates and instead use game landmarks as it lets the player retain a bit of a sense of achievement and isn't as rough with immersion.
</p>
<ul><li> Lynus is in the gorge just east of the Nova Lux gate.
</li><li> Koont Chief is between the beach and the plains, near a stone "structure"
</li><li> Koont Scout Leader is around 2700, 204. Just south of the road. He patrols up and down the ledge.
</li><li> Koont Trooper patrols south of the South Gherat River near the top of the loop in the road.
</li><li> Red Tooth is near the Light Defense Square. You turn in the quest at Trian, at the Tavern.
</li><li> To summon the possession monster for the Forgotten Relics (11) quest you must enter the <a href="Ruins_of_Lament.html" title="Ruins of Lament">Ruins of Lament</a> instance.
</li><li> The Ancient Slate for Treasure Hunter (2) is near the tree that has mother and young basilisks around. Actually, if you are close to the narrow gap, you'll see one big rock to the south of the road: the slate is near that rock.
</li><li> Arioch Eidan is in the Ruined Area pocket.
</li><li> Emperor Gramm is inside the Corrupted Palmer (Pilgrim) Group
</li></ul>
