<a name="Using_Summoned_Creatures"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Using Summoned Creatures </span></h2>
<p>Every Dominator has access to five Summons, and Defilers have three.  There are four attacking, and one illusion which basically acts as a meat shield.  Summons are very useful in Higher end PvE, but can be a pain to control at times.  This page will hopefully help with that.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="Summon_Kazara.html" title="Summon Kazara">Summon Kazara</a>     - Melee Attack (Available to Defiler). Skinned as Jumping Zombie Battle Form.  Uses Paralyse skill. Good use as tank.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="Summon_Lenatore.html" title="Summon Lenatore">Summon Lenatore</a>   - Ranged Attack (Available to Defiler). Skinned as Goblin Hunter.  Shoots Arrows.  Useful for taking a 2nd target of you
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="Summon_Nastech.html" title="Summon Nastech">Summon Nastech</a>    - Magic Attack.  Skinned as Arioch NM creature.  Uses Firepole skill.  DPS

<a name="Controls"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Controls </span></h2>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a class="image" href="Image_NameBars.html" title="Name Bars"><img alt="Name Bars" border="0" class="thumbimage" height="154" src="../../../../requiem-wiki.org/w/images/thumb/0/0a/NameBars.jpg/180px-NameBars.html" width="180"/></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a class="internal" href="Image_NameBars.html" title="Enlarge"><img alt="" height="11" src="../../../../requiem-wiki.org/w/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.html" width="15"/></a></div>Name Bars</div></div></div> <div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:54px;"><a class="image" href="Image_ControlBar.html" title="Controls"><img alt="Controls" border="0" class="thumbimage" height="356" src="../../../../requiem-wiki.org/w/images/6/61/ControlBar.html" width="52"/></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a class="internal" href="Image_ControlBar.html" title="Enlarge"><img alt="" height="11" src="../../../../requiem-wiki.org/w/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.html" width="15"/></a></div>Controls</div></div></div>
<p>Each Summon comes with its own Name Bar, and a Control bar.  The Control bar is the same for each Summon, but if you click on the Summon Name, the Control bar shows the current setting for that Summon.
</p><p>Even the Illusion will have a bar, although whatever setting it is on, it will just stand there and do nothing but be a distraction to the foe.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<a name="Pre-emptive_Attack"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Pre-emptive Attack </span></h2>
<p>Under this setting, your Summons will automatically attack any target that comes within range.  However, you can still use the attack and retreat options while set as Pre-emptive.<br/>
This setting can get a little messy especially if your in an area that is highly populated with foes.<br/>
This setting can be very useful for finding a one spawn spot, and leaving the Summons to attack while you're afk.  Be sure to watch on the 1st target though to make sure they are actually attacking, and that they can take down the foe without you.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<a name="Defense"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Defense </span></h2>
<p>Summons will only attack anything that attacks you.  Once the 1st hit has been made on you, they will auto attack that foe.  However, you can still send them to fight by using the Target Nearest / Attack method described in Manual Operation, but in Defense mode, they will only respond to foes with melee attack range.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<a name="Manual_Operation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Manual Operation </span></h2>
<p>In my opinion, this is a safer way of using your Summons.  They wont attack anything or anyone unless you command them to, using the command bar.  The easiest way to do this is set a key to "Target Nearest" and another key to "Attack".  When you want to start fighting, click on the 1st Summon, then press Target and Attack, and move to the 2nd Summon, and so on.  They will all then move in on the foe and kill it, usually without you taking any aggro.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<a name="Pulling"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Pulling </span></h2>
<p>Even though this class has a Range attack, pulling beyond the range of this attack without gaining any aggro is very easy.  Select the Summon, (I usually use Kazara) then click on the target foe.  Use the Control Bar to set the Kazara to Attack.  He will then run off toward the foe, even if it is way beyond your Skill Range.  Will not work in Defense Mode.
</p><p>Once the Kazara has got its 1st hit in, click on the Kazara Name bar again, and Retreat it using the Control Bar.  Both your Summon and the foe will then come to you.  Once within targeting range, set the other Summons on it, and you can kill this target usually without gaining any aggro.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<a name="Known_Problems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Known Problems </span></h2>
<ul><li>If the Lenatore gains aggro, it runs away to try and gain range, taking the foe and all your minions with it.  The best way to deal with this is always send in the Kazara 1st.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Summons attacking other players.  Not sure why this happens, it could be due to clicking the cursor on a player instead of a foe, as things can get a little hectic on screen, but they will attack a Party member, and even a Guild Member if told to do so.  If this happens, quickly select the Summon and Retreat it.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you use Return, all your Summons Name bars will sometimes dissappear, making it impossible to change thier setting.  You will need to re-summon. (under testing by Gravity)
</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you jump down a cliff face, the active summons may get confused and appear to be running constantly.  If this happens, it has been noted that an attacking foe will target you rather than your illusion.  Re-summoning is the best solution.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Involuntary Murderer.  If a low lvl player or a bot decides to start on your Summons, they will fight back if set on attack, and will generally win, making you into a murderer against your will.  I find this to be a flaw, but it does happen.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you are in the middle of killing a mob when another spawns on you, or within range of targeting you.  Once the pets have killed the 1st mob, they do not always attack the second mob.  There appears to be a delay between end of combat, and registering a new target.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you cast a Summon, then use any HP potion while it is casting, the Summon will fail to cast.
</li></ul>
