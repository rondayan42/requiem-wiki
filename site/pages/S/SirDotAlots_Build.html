<p>MY defiler build
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Bloody Arrow rank 5
</p><p>Rake Nail rank 2 (one of the ranks is a filler)
</p><p>Arrow of Ruin rank 5
</p><p>Bloody Arrow rank 1
</p><p>Curse Effect rank 5
</p><p>Blood Moon rank 6
</p><p>Blood Storm rank max
</p><p>Deadly Fog rank max
</p><p>lithryfying terror rank max
</p><p>Shadow Binding rank 1
</p><p>Blessing of wind 1
</p><p>Counterattack rank 5
</p><p>kazara rank 1
</p><p>trap fo stiffness rank max
</p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>
fillers (skills you have to get before you can progress .... everyone hates them )
</p><p>attack curse rank 1
</p><p>Rake Nail GET rank 1 of this skill but rank 2 just as a filler 
</p><p>invisibility rank 1
</p><p>soul shield rank 1
</p><p><br/>
reason why there so many id because i chose bleesing of wind over invis and you dont get it till later lvls
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>reason why i chose these skills
</p><p>bloody arrow ...... well good for chasing down those running poeple and main 1v1 dps
</p><p>Rake Nail alot of poeple disgre with this skill for defiler but i got it for 1v1 (solo) dps and pvp when your chasing down people wat u only use bloody arrow to kill them.. or you could do alot mroe damage using this skill aswell o.O
</p><p>arrow of ruin is a great aoe skill with the DNA biig explosion
</p><p>bloody arrow a decent aoe skill at rank 1 good when everythings in cooldown 
</p><p>curse effect my fav aoe skill other then the 3 non targets ones ( blood storm . trap of stiffness . deadly fog)
</p><p>blood moon a good aoe instant cast abit of damage works well with staff stll good with wand
</p><p>Blood Storm extremely good aoe no questions ask
</p><p>Deadly Fog  another great aoe 
</p><p>lithryfying terror this skill is the gem of a defiler this is like a rouge stealth to him alright put it this way at rank 60 its a 60 second stun you can still use trap of stiffness blood storm deadly fog and curse effect on them while there turned to stone ..... enough to kill anyone =p
</p><p>Shadow Binding rank one people say higher rank but i say no =p because you have enoug stun with the lithry fy terror but if you need them kept still to do it or stun then lithryfying terror again then this is your skill
</p><p>Blessing of wind antoher debate over this and invis invis does 23% with dna ok at lvl 60 that will do mroe then bless but hey your a defiler you dont get touch when your in a group so why waste points on invis when you can use blesing of wnd on the tank ect.. alot better i think
</p><p>Counterattack - primry defence at vll 5 + dna it does 65% to reflect 55% damage domne back melle and it also gives 
</p><p>kazara ok this is the most debateable skill to get being a defiler ok people say pets are useless as defiler and then they say lvl 1 is use less but i disagree ok dont even look at this skill as a pet.... i see it as a skill tht slow your oponent 50% for 5 seconds and it cast itself ok ... if you where a defiler and you could get tat skill at lvl 40 cost 1 point would u get it ? in solo it works wonders in pvp its great and people dont know what lvl they are and even might think your a dominator =p and take you diferently
</p><p>trap fo stiffness - defiler best skill stund confuses damages 
</p>
<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>play style
</p><p>SOLO  1v1
</p><p>ok in solo i send in my kazzy first make sure you hit the mob with arrow of ruin before your kazzy hits the target so he dont get agro then kite you should not get hit from kazara will just slow them down
</p><p><br/>
PARTY ?v?
</p><p>ok start with arrow of ruin- curse effect- trap of stiffness -deadly fog - blood storm - bloody spear blood moon and just go from cooldowns from there on, make sure u use all your non tartget aoes as soon as the clldown gows down( blood storm ect)
</p><p>PVP 
</p><p>everyone has their own pvp style but if you can lithryfying terror someone you beat them =] unless its mroe then 1v1 
-- and i havent done much pvp testing
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>GEAR
</p><p>just get reinforced everything 
</p><p>weapon - magical attack
</p><p>shield - add HP or INT
</p><p>armour - HP or INT
</p><p>depending on how you feel about your hp and damage
</p>
