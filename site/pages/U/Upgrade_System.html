<a name="Compounding_Equipment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Compounding Equipment</span></h2>
<p>Compounding is the process of increasing the strength of your weapons and armor. Through compounding the effective level of an item is increased. This translates into a <i>chance</i> for higher stats (STR, INT, HP Recovery, etc.) and <i>guaranteed</i> higher damage, physical defense, or block defense. The Level and <a href="Equipment_Mastery.html" title="Equipment Mastery">Equipment Mastery</a> prerequisites of an item will never go up through compounding. This means it's possible, for example, to wield the equivalent of a level 40 weapon as a level 15 character.
</p><p>Although compounding can be powerful, it's important to note that it is a gamble. Each time you compound an item there is a chance that you might fail and that the item will be <i>permanently lost</i>. It's generally good practice to have a spare piece of equipment you can fall back on should you lose the one you are attempting to compound.
</p><p>Only Weapons, (Magic) Shields, and Armor can be compounded. Jewelry can never be compounded.
</p>
<a name="Effects_of_Compounding"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Effects of Compounding</span></h3>
<p>There are five upgrades available beyond the base level that all items start at. Each time an item is upgraded through compounding, the defense of armors, and attack of weapons go up. The amount varies depending on item type, and level
</p>
<table class="wikitablec">
<tr>
<td> <b>Upgrade</b>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Fortis
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Amplio
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Melior
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Ulterius
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Potens
</td></tr></table>
<dl><dd>For Example: When compounded, a Dull Wand (a level 10 item) will become a Fortis Dull Wand. When compounded again it will become an Amplio Dull Wand.
</dd></dl>
<p>Dull Crossbow has 24 attack <br/>
Fortis Dull Crossbow has 30 attack (25% increase) <br/>
Amplio Dull Crossbow has 35 attack (17% increase from Fortis) <br/>
Amplio Dull Crossbow is a little stronger than Fides Crossbow (33 attack) <br/>
</p><p>Brutal Blaze Claw: 180 - 225 <br/>
Fortis Brutal Blaze Claw: 194 - 245 (+8% - +9% increase) <br/>
Amplio Brutal Blaze Claw: 215 - 267 (+11% - +9% increase) <br/>
Melior Brutal Blaze Claw: 234 - 292 (+9% - +9% increase) <br/>
</p><p>The increase in Effective Level of an item results in two things:
</p>
<ol><li>The Damage, Physical Defense, or Block Defense is increase by a <i>set amount</i>. This amount depends on item type (dual sword, wand, cloth armor, leather armor, etc.) and the starting level of the item.
</li><li>The Stats (STR, INT, etc.) assigned to an item have a higher <i>maximum</i> value.
</li></ol>
<p>Although the damage and defense of an item is guaranteed to increase, the stats are <i>randomly reassigned</i> with the new higher <i>maximum</i> values and may or may not increase. 
</p>
<dl><dd>For Example: A sword might have a possible STR range of 0~3. Upon entering the game world, the sword's STR is randomly assigned a value in that range. If you were to compound that sword it's STR range might then become 0~4, but upon being compounded it's STR is randomly reassigned a value in the new range.
</dd></dl>
<p>Note that compounding an item will result in the loss of previous Reinforcement Xeons applied to that item.
</p>
<a name="Process_of_Compounding"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Process of Compounding</span></h3>
<p>To compound an item you need the following:
</p>
<ul><li><b>The Weapon or Armor</b> to be compounded. Only items that have the [Compoundable] tag in their tooltip are eligible.
</li><li><b> One Compound Xeon</b>. The Compound Xeon needed is determined by the name of the item and the upgrade level from which it's being compounded. For example: A Fortis Dull Wand will require a Fortis Dull Compound Xeon to be compounded to an Amplio Dull Wand.
</li><li><b>Basic Xeons of the item's Grade</b>. The number of Basic Xeons needed increases with the Level of the item and the upgrade level from which it's being compounded (Fortis, Amplio, etc.). The type of Basic Xeon needed is the same as the item's Grade (Ordinary, Supernus, etc.).
</li><li><b>Lant</b>. Lant cost increases with the Level of the item and the upgrade level from which it's being compounded.
</li></ul>
<p>Compounding is conducted through an Item Compound Blacksmith NPC located in the major towns. To begin compounding right click the NPC and insert the item to be compounded into the first slot. Then chose the upgrade option from the list on the right. Then insert the Compound Xeon into the second slot, and the indicated number of Basic Xeons into the third slot. The fourth slot is thought to be reserved for cash shop coupons not yet available in REQUIEM. Take note of the "Chance" of success. Upon a successful compound the upgraded item will appear in your first open inventory slot. Failure results in the loss of the item and all materials involved.
</p>
<a name="Reinforcing_Equipment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reinforcing Equipment</span></h2>
<p>Reinforcing equipment is the process of inserting Reinforcement Xeons into Reinforcement Slots in your equipment in order to enhance particular stats. Any piece of <a href="Items.html#Equipment" title="Items">equipment</a> can be be reinforced; jewelry included. The number of reinforcement slots available on a particular piece of equipment is generally equal to it's level/10, rounded down (1 at 10, 1 at 15, 2 at 20, etc.).
</p><p>You may reinforce any combination of Reinforcement Xeons into your equipment. The only restrictions pertain to the type of Reinforcement Xeon used:
</p>
<ul><li>Weapon Reinforcement Xeons, <a class="image" href="Image_Xeon_Reinforcement_Weapon.html" title="Xeon Reinforcement Weapon.gif"><img alt="" border="0" height="30" src="../../../../requiem-wiki.org/w/images/thumb/6/65/Xeon_Reinforcement_Weapon.gif/30px-Xeon_Reinforcement_Weapon.html" width="30"/></a>,  can only be applied to weapons and no other equipment.
</li><li>Armor Reinforcement Xeons, <a class="image" href="Image_Xeon_Reinforcement_Armor.html" title="Xeon Reinforcement Armor.gif"><img alt="" border="0" height="30" src="../../../../requiem-wiki.org/w/images/thumb/1/1b/Xeon_Reinforcement_Armor.gif/30px-Xeon_Reinforcement_Armor.html" width="30"/></a>, can only be applied to armor or shields and no other equipment.
</li><li>All other Reinforcement Xeons can be applied to any piece of equipment.
</li></ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<a name="Effects_of_Reinforcing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Effects of Reinforcing</span></h3>
<p>The effects of reinforcement depends exactly on which type of Reinforcement Xeon you used. A +2 STR xeon reinforced into your helm, for example, will bestow an additional +2 STR in addition to any natural or reinforced STR already present on the helm.
</p><p>A weapon with at least one Reinforcement Slot filled will display a glow around the blade or head of the weapon. The color of the glow is dependent on the type of weapon according to this table:
</p>
<table class="wikitablec">
<tr>
<td> <b>Weapon Type</b> </td><td> <b>Glow Color</b>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Claw </td><td> Purple
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Crossbow </td><td> Red
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Dual Sword </td><td> Amber
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> One or Two Handed Axe </td><td> Blue
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> One or Two Handed Bludgeon </td><td> Blue
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> One or Two Handed Sword </td><td> Red
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Staff </td><td> Turquiose
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Wand </td><td> Turquiose
</td></tr></table>
<p>A weapon with 4 or more Reinforcement Slots filled will display a glowing rune around the weapon's hilt. The rune differs according to the number of filled slots, and weapon type. <br/>
A weapon with 6 Reinforcement Slots filled will display a larger, more elaborate glowing rune around the weapon.
</p><p>It is important to note that if you later compound an already reinforced item, all previous reinforcements on that item will be lost.
</p>
<a name="Process_of_Reinforcing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Process of Reinforcing</span></h3>
<p>To reinforce an item you need the following:
</p>
<ul><li><b>The Piece of Equipment</b> to be reinforced. Only items that have an available Reinforcement Slot are eligible.
</li><li><b> One Reinforcement Xeon</b>. Only one Reinforcement Xeon may be applied to an item at a time.
</li><li><b>Basic Xeons of the item's Grade</b>. The number of Basic Xeons needed increases with the level of the item. The type of Basic Xeon needed is the same as the item's Grade (Ordinary, Supernus, etc.).
</li><li><b>Lant</b>. Lant cost increases with the level of the item.
</li></ul>
<p>Reinforcing is conducted through an Item Reinforcement Blacksmith NPC located in the major towns. To begin reinforcing right click the NPC and choose the "Reinforce Item" option. Insert the item to be reinforced into the first slot. Then insert the Reinforcement Xeon into the second slot, and the indicated number of Basic Xeons into the third slot. Take note of the "Chance" of success. After a successful or failed reinforcement the item will appear in your first open inventory slot.
</p><p>Regardless of whether a reinforcement succeeds or fails, the slot you used for that reinforcement will be expended. A failed result will read, for example, "0/1(-1)" if the item initially had 0/2 Reinforcement Slots and now has one failed reinforcement attempt. Unlike compounding, reinforcing an item can never result in the loss of that item.
</p>
<a name="Compounding_Reinforcement_Xeons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Compounding Reinforcement Xeons</span></h2>
<p>Reinforcement Xeons can be compounded to increase the bonuses they apply when reinforced into your weapons or armor. To do so requires any 2 compoundable Reinforcement Xeons, 14 Basic Xeons, and some Lant. The compounding is conducted at an Item Compound Blacksmith NPC. Success chance is "Average". Failure results in the loss of all materials. Only xeons that reinforce the same piece of equipment (i.e. armor or weapon) are eligible to be compounded together. Previously compounded Reinforcement Xeons cannot be compounded further.
</p><p>When compounding xeons together, the order in which they are inserted into the Compounding Window will determine what sort of xeon you end up with. The primary slot and will always bestow it's full effects on the final compounded xeon. The second slot will bestow roughly one third to one half of it's effects on the final compounded xeon, depending on the particular xeon used.
</p><p>This table shows the results of compounded Reinforcement Xeons when used in the secondary slot of the Compounding Window.

<p>Example 1: A +2 INT xeon in the primary slot and a +15 MP xeon in the secondary slot will produce a Reinforcement Xeon that gives +2 INT and +5 MP.
<br/>Example 2: A +30 Accuracy xeon in the primary slot and a +30 Accuracy Xeon in the secondary slot will produce a Reinforcement Xeon that gives +40 Accuracy.

<a name="Compounding_Basic_Xeons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Compounding Basic Xeons</span></h2>
<p>Basic Xeons can be compounded to increase their <a href="Grade.html" title="Grade">Grade</a> to the next highest grade. To do so requires any 20 Basic Xeons of the same grade and some Lant. The chance of success and Lant costs increase with the grade from which you are compounding. 
</p><p>Basic Xeon compounding is conducted at an Item Compound Blacksmith NPC. Insert 10 Basic Xeons into the primary slot and 10 Basic Xeons of the same grade into the secondary slot. Success yields 10 Basic Xeons of the next highest grade. Failure results in the loss of all materials.
