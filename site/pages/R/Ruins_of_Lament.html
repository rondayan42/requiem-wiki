<a name="Background"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Background </span></h2>
<p>The special magic of the ancient Kun race held the their glorious city up in the skies. However, the Kuns lost the war between the Races, and their city crashed to the ground: what is left is now known as the Ruins of Lament. The ruins have slowly begun to erode and become buried by the passage of time. 
</p>
<a name="Description"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Description </span></h2>
<p>Ruins of Lament is an instanced dungeon. Each instance is reserved for one party. The instance will reset after all players have exited. Monsters inside this dungeon do not respawn.
</p><p><a href="Equipment_Sets.html#Freiza_Armor_Set" title="Equipment Sets">Frezia</a> and <a href="Equipment_Sets.html#Khrentium_Armor_Set" title="Equipment Sets">Khrentium</a> armor and compound xeons can drop from any of the monsters in this dungeon.
</p><p><a href="Equipment_Sets.html#Lamenting_Cry_Armor_Set" title="Equipment Sets">Lamenting Cry</a> and <a href="Equipment_Sets.html#Lamenting_Sound_Armor_Set" title="Equipment Sets">Lamenting Sound</a> armor can drop from the bosses in this dungeon.
</p><p>There are five bosses to this dungeon, however only the last two drop Lamenting armor.
</p><p>The first boss is in the initial room, guarded by two mobs, and drops a Heart of Lamentation.
</p><p>The second boss, drops a key to one of 3 rooms to the fourth boss.
</p><p>The third boss is optional (actually the easiest monster in the dungeon).  Defeating him completes a part of the Forgotten Relics quest, necessary to obtain one's Possession Beast.
</p><p>The fourth boss will cast a spell on one target to regain HP when low.  With enough damage being dealt, you'll hardly see this spell being used at all.  He is susceptible to sleep only occasionally (need to check, but usually my first sleep hits, all following fail).  This boss drops an Organ Key, which when used on the organ in the center of the dungeon, reveals a short cutscene.
</p><p>The final boss is located in one of 3 rooms on the upper levels.  One must cross a bridge which appears after the cutscene to get there.  He uses a stun attack which lasts a few seconds in addition to normal attacks.
</p><p>Note that if any of the keys are not retrieved before they vanish, the party can not continue through the dungeon.  Also, if you leave the dungeon without using a key, the key remains in your inventory and can be used during a different run.  The keys are untradable.
</p>
<a name="Entry_Requirements"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Entry Requirements </span></h2>
<p>A character must be level 23 or higher to be allowed access into the dungeon.
