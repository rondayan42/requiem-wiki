<p>An entry was found near the Ion Tree of Fire in North Hammerine, into the lair of a fire breathing dragon believed to be even more violent than Ruinhorn. He is rumored to never leave his lair, however many are too fearful to even get close enough to check.
</p><p><a href="Doom_Cheras.html" title="Doom Cheras">Doom Cheras</a> is a dragon that is not interested in anything but his own territory. Being a fire type dragon, he is said to be to most violent among dragons. He does not leave his domain and remains in his cave and sleeps.
</p><p><br/>
Recently, <a href="Doom_Cheras.html" title="Doom Cheras">Doom Cheras</a>' lair was found near the Ion Tree of Fire in North Hammerine. People see it as a dangerous creature just like <a href="Ruinhorn.html" title="Ruinhorn">Ruinhorn</a> considering it as something that needs to be defeated. With an uncontrollable rage, Doom Cheras destroys anything.
