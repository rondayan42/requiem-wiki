<a name="Usage"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Usage</span></h1>
<p>This is an endgame mystic useful for AoE parties but fares fine solo.  If you are very skilled, you MIGHT be able to do fine in PvP but this really isn't meant for it at all.  At lower lvl's you will win in PvP because Shaman's are overpowered but in the higher levels you will almost positively get owned if you follow this build.<br/>
This build is meant to play in the backline of AoE parties.  With hp xeon reinforced armor, you might be able to solo AoE grind but higher lvl elite mobs generally tear through you.
<br/>Also, this build might be difficult to level up from.  It is entirely possible but it would be best to reskill and take on this build at 60+.
</p>
<a name="Equipment_Choices"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Equipment Choices</span></h1>
<p>I use a wand and magic shield and best cloth armor I can farm/afford. C-I set will make sure you barely have to sit down when grinding and will give you a ton of extra damage.  M-I set can be useful for soloing but I always prefer to kite to take minimal damage.
</p>
<a name="Attributes_and_Reinforcement"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Attributes and Reinforcement</span></h2>
<p>Damage Scales with int so I always reinforce my shield with int xeons, wand with magic attack power xeons, and armor with HP xeons.  You can almost double your HP reinforcing with HP 30 xeons.
</p>
<a name="Weapons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Weapons</span></h2>
<p>Wand, Magic Shield
You can use a staff but I prefer wand.
</p>
<a name="Point_Allocation"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Point Allocation</span></h1>
<p><b>Enemy Control</b><br/>
<a href="Chaos_Totem.html" title="Chaos Totem">Chaos Totem</a> (5) - Definitely need to level this up 4 at least<br/>
<a href="Loa%27s_Curse.html" title="Loa's Curse">Loa's Curse</a> (6) - I use this skill mostly in SL and now WS when no tank and we have to kite the boss and no one has holy bolt or kazara. pretty useful
</p><p><b>AoE</b><br/>
<a href="Fire_Totem.html" title="Fire Totem">Fire Totem</a> (5) - I ran out of skills to add so i figured this one is alright for a bit of extra AoE damage.  This isn't a priority.  Add this skill after adding everything else<br/>
<a href="Burning_Meteor.html" title="Burning Meteor">Burning Meteor</a> (4) - This skill has AoE stun.  Take it to 3 at least since the stun maxes at 3 sec for lvl 3<br/>
<a href="Burning_Hell.html" title="Burning Hell">Burning Hell</a> (7) - Great AoE skill with DoT<br/>
<a href="Hellfire.html" title="Hellfire">Hellfire</a> (1) - Sadly mystics can only take this to 1. but great skill nonetheless<br/>
<a href="Soul_Explosion.html" title="Soul Explosion">Soul Explosion</a> (4) - Good AoE skill and can also be used to unstealth rogues if you are lucky<br/>
</p><p><b>Buffs</b><br/>
<a href="Bloodlust.html" title="Bloodlust">Bloodlust</a> (4) - Our only party buff really and well worth it<br/>
<a href="Vindictive_Mind.html" title="Vindictive Mind">Vindictive Mind</a> (10) - Passive buff for more damage.<br/>
<a href="Flame_Shield.html" title="Flame Shield">Flame Shield</a> (5) - Invest in this. One of our best skills.  I tested it against a warrior a few levels lower than me and it killed him and left me with half my hp left without ever throwing a fireball<br/>
<a href="Mana_Amulet.html" title="Mana Amulet">Mana Amulet</a> (5) - In the low levels get the strengthened DNA for this.  In the higher levels after getting a C-I set, it DNA isn't needed so much<br/>
</p><p><b>Solo Attacks</b><br/>
<a href="Fire_Ball.html" title="Fire Ball">Fire Ball</a> (5) - Get this.. obviously<br/>
<a href="Flame_Arrow.html" title="Flame Arrow">Flame Arrow</a> (5) - It has horrible downtime but I when used like Fireball -&gt; Flame Arrow -&gt; Fireball, it basically gives massive DPS because the balls fire consecutively. Also has splashed damage so i guess i can throw this in AoE<br/>
</p><p><b>Fillers</b><br/>
<a href="Home_Remedy.html" title="Home Remedy">Home Remedy</a> (1)<br/>
<a href="Fire_Rain.html" title="Fire Rain">Fire Rain</a> (1)
<br/><br/>
THIS BUILD LEAVES 3 POINTS UNALLOCATED BUT I CONSIDER IT FINISHED. THERE REALLY IS NOTHING WORTHWHILE TO ADD
