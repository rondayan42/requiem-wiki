<a name="Overview"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Overview </span></h2>
<p>Requiem Online's Possession Beast System is a unique feature that can endow characters with immense power and abilities to survive difficult situations or to speed up hunting. There are different kinds of Possession Beast, each with the own unique skills, that grow and develop along with the character. 
</p>
<a name="Quest"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Quest </span></h2>
<p>Players can begin the quest to obtain a Possession Beast once his or her character reaches Level 23. This is a long quest chain called <a href="Forgotten_Relics.html" title="Forgotten Relics">Forgotten Relics</a> in <a href="Crescent.html" title="Crescent">Crescent</a> that consists of 13 parts and can only be completed once. The first part of the quest comes from an NPC in <a href="Valdes.html" title="Valdes">Valdes</a> named Elian, found in the unidentified room located south of the Official Residence. If questing in Turba, it can be obtained from the Mayor in Zakate. If the Possession Beast obtained from this quest is destroyed, or if more Possession Beasts are desired, then players must collect Pieces of Possession Beast from monsters.

</p>
<a name="Obtaining"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Obtaining </span></h2>
<p>Nightmare monsters at Level 32 or above will drop Pieces of Possession Beast Pieces at a certain probability. There are four types of Possession Beast Pieces that will create a Possession Beast when combined. These Pieces of Possession Beast can be traded among players at the Auction Hall.  You do not need to complete the quest in order to purchase and combine the pieces.
</p>
<a name="Usage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Usage </span></h2>
<div class="floatright"><span><a class="image" href="Image_Hardcoregauge.html" title="Hardcoregauge.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" height="100" src="../../../../requiem-wiki.org/w/images/a/a9/Hardcoregauge.html" width="600"/></a></span></div>
<p>Possession Beasts are very powerful, but their usage is limited. Characters can only transform into a Possession Beast after filling the Hardcore Gauge to at least 90%, which slowly fills as players kill monsters. The Hardcore gauge is displayed in the character target window. 
</p><p>Transforming into a Possession Beast is similar to how players use skills. Players can click the Possession Beast icon (In the 'Possession Beast' Menu), or drag and drop the icon into the shortcut bar, and then press the corresponding Shortcut key. Players can then use the skills of their Possession Beast in a similar fashion. 
</p><p>NOTE: Players cannot transform into Possession Beasts unless their Hardcore gauge is at 90% or more.
