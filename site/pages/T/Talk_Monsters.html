<a name="Format"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Format </span></h2>
<p>Anyone have any ideas for formating this section?
</p><p>Things to include per monster:
</p>
<ul><li>Name, Level(s), Skills, Location
</li><li>Aggressive: Yes / No
</li><li>Normal / Elite / Nightmare / Boss
</li><li>Exp and Lant per level
</li><li>Spawn cycle: Normal / Daytime / Nightmare / None
</li><li>Any special drops: Quest starters / Set gear / Boss drops
</li><li>Anything else?
</li></ul>
<p>Each map and submap (dungeon) should be divided into their own pages. Obviously there's a lot of mobs in each of the overworld maps. If we start to incorporate a lot of information for each mob, the tables could get pretty crowded and perhaps unsortable. I'm thinking seperate pages for each mob would be the way to go. I suppose linking through categories would be the easiest to set-up and maintain. Anyone else have any feedback? --<a href="User_Redruin.html" title="User:Redruin">Redruin</a> 23:38, 28 April 2008 (MDT)

<dl><dd>The way I see it, since a wiki is not built to be the kind of raw database that's really needed to display this type of info, there's no way around it other than cramming too much info for them.  Seeing as Requiem doesn't currently have a database like Ragnarok does, I guess I can't really go against doing it that way, but I don't really like having 1 page/monster since the scope is just enormous, and you better make sure each page is categorized lest you "forget" about some of them. --<a href="User_Resplendent.html" title="User:Resplendent">Resplendent</a> 10:26, 29 April 2008 (MDT)

I agree, I kind of like the monsters in a list as they are.  But there is just too much information that needs to be displayed for each monster for it to work out.  Maybe a sort of compromise could be possible?  Have the monsters in a sortable table with some basic information, and then clicking the monster entry's name and/or picture would link to more detailed information.  It sounds good in theory.  If that doesn't work then I think I'd stand by Redruin's suggestion of separate pages.  --<a href="User_Noir.html" title="User:Noir">Noir</a> 18:36, April 29, 2008 (EDT)

<p>I wouldn't add ANYTHING new about monsters until OB.  Lord knows the whole wiki will probably be instantly outdated once it starts. --<a href="User_Resplendent.html" title="User:Resplendent">Resplendent</a> 07:51, 30 April 2008 (MDT)
</p><p>I've added a section for all the dungeon monsters ( since these are all elite and have different lvl ranges than their outside counterparts. 
</p><p>I also started to plug in monsters for parness. Most of them are listed under daytime mobs as i think we should not break it down so much. 
</p><p>Maybe only categorize them as Normal and Nightmare, then on the normal side of things have columns to denote elite or daytime only.
