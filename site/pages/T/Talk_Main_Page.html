<a name="My_little_Review_of_Open_Beta_version"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> My little Review of Open Beta version </span></h2>
<p>The character graphics are better then Lord of the Rings online, Guild Wars and certain as World of Warcraft (only AoC could beats the graphics of Requiem till now) and they're still updating the enviroment to make it more living. They intoduced new inviroments like snow storm and a frequent dynamic day/night system for more variation. When you start playing the game you need to get used to the graphics, but when you play for a longer time and explore new content(after around 3-4 hours), you will start liking them.
</p><p>The game world is also increasing and is now around 2x the size world of warcraft (with BC expansion). The gameplay realy rocks and is very exciting. Also the 4th race will be added in korea this month and will be introduced a few weeks after this in the European version. The sound is fresh and has lots of diffrent themes, but it needs a bit more variation from time to time.
</p><p>Its free and the Open Beta is current running. The 3rd server you could chose is a PK server but noone is playing there cause Player kill servers aren't that loved :P. The first server is realy busy at the other hand, but the community is very helpful and friendly so this isn't any problem.
</p><p>At the official release this game will still be free and will not have a monthly fee to pay and will be at 19/06/2008 (the closed beta ends 12/06/2008).
</p><p>The only few things that they realy have to improve is the quest text or add a location tracker like guild wars has, balance the servers more cause around 1x every 2 hours you are kicked of the server and add Anisotrophic, cause now you need to enable this in control panel and with it the game looks lots better (I tried it with 16x Anisotrophic and with off the only main thing is that you need at least the recommended system requirements to enable this, if you don't want to get a bad framerate).
</p><p>Nots till now:
</p>
<pre>   * Gameplay: 7.4 (the graphics will be updated with the official version, cause in open beta only low graphics are available)
   * Graphics: 8.8
   * Sound: 7.8
   * Community:9.1 (everyone is very helpful and kind)
</pre>
<p>(tested on a 4200+, 2gb ddr800, 7900gtx 512mb).

<a name="To_anybody_who_knows"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> To anybody who knows </span></h2>
<p>...such as Robertjanvaneijk1988, who was a part of the Beta testing- there are Unimplemented Weapons in the <a href="Items.html" title="Items">Items</a> page. Do you know if these are current future plans, or if they were plans canceled in the beta stage?
