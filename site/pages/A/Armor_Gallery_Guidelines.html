<p>To keep things running smoothly and without incident, I felt it was best to offer some sort of format for the Galleries.
<b>Note:</b> These guidelines might change as the gallery expands :)
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<a name="Armor_Gallery_Heavy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Armor Gallery Heavy </span></h2>
<p>This gallery is for images ONLY. It is perfectly ok to link to a larger image as long as a preview/thumb is available.
</p><p><br/>
1. DO NOT replace/move/edit another persons image WITHOUT asking them first. It is understood that you may have a better image, but please respect the work the previous user put in. It doesn't take long to send them a message. The only exceptions to this is if the users image does not work properly (ie. broken link), isnt formatted correctly (i.e should be an image and not a link), or if the game is updated in a way in which the old image is obselete (ie. They made a new part of the armor visible, etc). Otherwise, if you feel an additional image is needed, please add it to our graphics light version.
</p><p>2. Please try and keep images small enough to prevent page stretching. If you wish to keep a large file, please create a thumbnail view.( When all images are finally in place some formatting might occur in order to keep the page in "order")
</p><p>3. If you can please provide a front and back view. More views are great as well.
</p><p>4. Links to other Req Wiki pages are preferred, to help prevent formatting issues.
</p><p>5. Please try to include your name or the name of the person who created the screen shot. It doesn't have to be a remarkably large tag, just big enough to read. It is also ok if you wish not to.
</p>
<a name="Armor_Gallery_Light"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Armor Gallery Light </span></h2>
<p>This gallery will display links to images, for those users concerned about bandwith or those who don't want to see a plethora of images.
</p><p><br/>
1. As with the Heavy version, PLEASE DO NOT replace anyone else's images. This gallery can host a variety of images. If you have another version of a file already in existance, please feel free to add a link to it. (The same exceptions apply)
</p><p>2. Some image pages require a different code to display a link to your image. For normal images the code is [ [:image:(linkhere)| Image One] ] (without spaces). For some images [ [media:(imagelink)| Image One] ] (without spaces) should work.
</p><p>3. Links to other Req Wiki pages are preferred, to help prevent formatting issues.
</p><p>4. Please try to include your name or the name of the person who created the screen shot. It doesn't have to be a remarkably large tag, just big enough to read. It is also ok if you wish not to.
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><b>Notice:</b> Please note I have a backup archive of past pages, so if something is broken, please don't hesitate to shoot me a line. I will be more than happy to help wherever I can. Thank you to EVERYONE who is assisting with this gallery. Your work has made this possible!
