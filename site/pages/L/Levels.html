<a name="Overview"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Overview </span></h2>
<p>Each character's strengths and abilities are measured by their level. A character's level begins at 1 and can increase to a maximum of 71 and 100% xp
</p><p>In order for a character's level to increase, they must earn Experience Points. Experience Points ("EXP") can be gained either through killing <a href="Monsters.html" title="Monsters">monsters</a> or completing <a href="Quests.html" title="Quests">quests</a>. EXP can be lost through character death. The amount lost scales to level and is roughly equal to 5% at level 10 and 1.5% at level 60. Character death can never lower a character's EXP to less than 0% and so will never result in the loss of a level.
Basic accounts loose 30% less XP on death, and premium accounts loose 50% less XP on death.
</p><p>Each time a character gains a level, that character gains a single <a href="Skill_Points.html" title="Skill Points">Skill Point</a> which can be used to learn a new Skill or to develop a Skill already learned. Additional skill points are granted after Class Changes and upon achieving levels 30 and 60.
</p><p>Each level gained also increases the base <a href="Stats.html" title="Stats">Stats</a> of a character by a set amount dependant on the character's class choice. 
</p><p>Additionaly, a higher character level allows access to higher level <a class="mw-redirect" href="Item.html#Equipment" title="Item">equipment</a> and quests (both of which are all character level restricted).

<a name="First_Job.28Class.29_Choice"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> First Job(Class) Choice </span></h3>
<p>At lv 10, you can advance to your first job class.
Each race has 2 jobs they can choose at lv 10, after completing a advancement quest.
</p><p>Advancement from a Temperion to a First Class is a complete change in character type. Temperion Stats, Skills, Skill Points do not carry over to a character's First Class. The character's new Stats are based solely on the First Class choice.
</p><p>A character's Skill Points are set to 3 upon choosing their First Class.
</p><p>You can play as Temperion beyond level 9, but if you want to change your job at you have to do the First Choice Quest given by the Temperion DNA Manager in Rondel, if you begin in Crescent, or in Kurt if you begin in Turba. If you completed the Temperion Skill Test Quests while you are a Temperion the Temperion Skills will remain in your skill window even after you use skill reset.
Class skills will be wiped, and you regain all skill points spent.
</p>
<a name="Advanced_Class_Choice"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Advanced Class Choice </span></h3>
<p>At level 50. You can then change your job by talking to a Temperion Master and change your Job. (You can still Level up in your first class, but your mastery´s won´t increase if you don´t change job.)
</p><p>An Advanced Class is a natural extension of a character's First Class choice. All First Class Stats, Skills, and spent or unspent Skill Points are retained. Additional skill choices become available in the "2nd Job" tab of the Skill Window. An additional 4 skill points are earned when a character chooses their Advanced Class.
