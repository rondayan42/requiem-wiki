<p>Regardless of whether you're in Turba or Crescent, once you reach level 10, you have to complete a string of quests to get your 1st job.  Accomplish this by talking to the Temperion DNA Manager (known as Damon in Rondel, Crescent and Zio in Kurt, Turba) and complete the subsequent quests.  Once you have completed them, go talk to the Temperion Master, change your job, and accept your three Skill Points.

<p>That is done via item reinforcement. Compounding alone does not cause the glow effect. Information on compounding and reinforcement can be found <a href="Upgrade_System.html#Compounding_Equipment" title="Upgrade System">here</a>.

<a name="Where_are_the_Mutant_Sea_Lions_and.2For_the_Krebiz.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Where are the Mutant Sea Lions and/or the Krebiz?</span></h3>
<p>Similar to how Nightmare monsters appear only at certain hours, some monsters are daytime(5:00 ~ 19:00) monsters and therefore don't spawn during night.

<a name="I_get_a_message_about_some_Internet_cafe_expiring._What_is_that.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> I get a message about some Internet cafe expiring. What is that? </span></h3>
<p>This message indicates your basic/premium membership is about to expire. 
<br/><b>Note:</b> The timing of it is a bit off, so it may give you a "5 minute" notification for about half an hour &gt;.&lt;

<a name="I_see_people_riding_on_some_kind_of_animal._How_do_I_get_one.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> I see people riding on some kind of animal. How do I get one? </span></h3>
<p>They are riding a type of mount. There are currently two ways to get one. The first is via the Item Shop, but you will have to pay real money for them. The second is to do the quest called "<a class="new" href="http://requiem-wiki.org/w/index.php?title=Lost_rex_Cage&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Lost rex Cage (not yet written)">Lost Rex Cage</a>" at level 30,if you finished the quest you can buy a Rex (50.000 Lant). The Cash shop mounts are faster than the Rex, but also have time limits. So far the Rex, from the in game quest, has no such limit.

Where are they? </span></h3>
<p>The quests suggests that the crystals are to be found due east of Rondel. The crystals are actually "southeast" of Rondel, rather than directly eastward.

<a name="I_have_a_quest_that_asks_for_Mini_Golem_Claw._I.27ve_been_killing_golems_for_HOURS_and_haven.27t_gotten_one_claw.21_why.21.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> I have a quest that asks for Mini Golem Claw. I've been killing golems for HOURS and haven't gotten one claw! why!? </span></h3>
<p>This quest is bugged. You need "Mini Gropie Claws", from "Wild Small Gropies". You can find them by the Blackhand Debouchment in Crescent and in the El-rima Desert in Turba.

<p>This quest is bugged. His name is Jaff and he is to be found close to the Prison gate near the fireplace.

<a name="When_I_start_Requiem:Bloodymare.2C_the_Updater_does_not_show_any_progress_and_then_I_get_an_error_6_message_.27Failed_to_connect_to_Internet.27"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> When I start Requiem:Bloodymare, the Updater does not show any progress and then I get an error 6 message 'Failed to connect to Internet' </span></h3>
<p>That sometimes happens when the servers are down for testing or implementing new content. Otherwise it means your computer simply does not have an available Internet connection, or that a firewall of some sort is getting in the way. The problem can also be directed at your Internet Service Provider (ISP). It involves the path your ISP uses to get to the Requiem site and its servers. In that case, it's a waiting game and there's not much you can do about it, other then complain directly to your ISP and hope enough people do the same.

<a name="I_get_horrible_lag_in_the_game.2C_and_other_people_seem_to_move_faster_than_me._What.27s_going_on.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> I get horrible lag in the game, and other people seem to move faster than me. What's going on? </span></h3>
<p>This could be do to quite a few issues. From not having enough RAM on your computer, to the area you are in just being laggy period. Some places such as "the instance" for party quest sections have lag regardless. If you are having overall game lag, try and check your graphics card. In some cases, it may be trying to give the game rules in which it can't handle. Search the manufacturers website for your graphics card manual. If your card has options to "Allow The Application To Control" particular settings, try making those changes. If this does not help or you are not comfortable changing settings on your PC, try contacting the Requiem support team. They may have a host of other options for you to try.
