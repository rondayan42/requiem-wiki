</p><p>Biskra is the master of Giant Ammonite, you need 4 People to enter. <a href="South_Hammerine_Wood.html" title="South Hammerine Wood">South Hammerine Wood</a>. 
</p>
<a name="Skills.2A"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Skills* </span></h2>
<p><b>Weakening</b>: 
</p><p><b>Doppelganger</b>:(Lvl 60) Biskra will cast a Doppelganger (Lvl 60) of himself at regular intervals. The Doppelganger, much like a <a href="Rogue.html" title="Rogue">Rogue</a>'s <a href="Doppleganger_Magic.html" title="Doppleganger Magic">Doppleganger Magic</a>, will only attack with melee, but don't take it lightly. It is very strong, and very tough, and you should take it down as quickly as possible.
There is 3 types of Dopplegangers. (A) is immune to all attacks except melee attacks, (B) is immune to all attacks except Ranged attacks, (C) is immune to all attacks, except magic attacks.
When Biskra summon a doppleganger, just attack it, and see if you deal any damage. If you deal 0 damage, go back and attack biskra, while other members take care of Doppleganger.
The Dopplegangers use AOE slows, which decrease move speed by 80%, and increase cast time of skills by 100%.
(A) also cast 15 sec, AOE fear, which is a huge nuicence, since you need melee attacks to kill it.
AOE fear only has 20sec or so cooldown as well, which doesnt leave you much time to attack the Dopple.
</p><p><b>Whirlpool</b>: Biskra's area of effect spell (20m radius). Casters are able to nuke at a safe distance without suffering damage. It will do upwards of 2500 damage, depending on level and resistance.
</p><p><b>Sea of Recovery</b>: At below 50% health, Biskra will regularly cast this skill, which recovers 10000HP (used to restore 10k hp every 2 sec, for 1min)
</p><p><b>Deadly Sea</b>: At below 40% health or so, Biskra will start using an area DoT (damage over time) spell, centered around himself. He casts it at a frequency whereby it is always present, unless interrupted. The damage is extremely powerful, weighing in at 500/1.
</p><p><b>Wrath</b>: Biskra will cast self buff increasing his strength by 300.
</p>
<pre>Range of Biskra's skill Geyser and Weakening skill has been changed to 100m each.
</pre>
<p><b>Geyser</b>: 1,7k (Stune? 15-20m (did biskra last week sometimes..))
</p><p><br/>
<b>Melee Swing</b>: 2,5K+, crit 4,5K+
