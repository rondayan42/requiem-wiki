<p>These guidelines are made to ensure that people post high quality information to be shared with other Requiem players. Violations of any of these rules will result in losing the ability to create / edit and you won't get them back for a long time to come. 
</p>
<a name="Rules_for_Requiem_Wiki_Users"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rules for Requiem Wiki Users</span></h2>
<ol><li> Don't put in any text that is known to be false (and you know it is false too). If you honestly thought whatever info you put in was true but you don't know for 100% sure, please put a note such as (verify?) in your edits so people can help you find the fact. 
</li><li> You are not allowed to make any sort of personal attacks on any of the pages. 
</li><li> Do not post anything that will cause drama. All pages are supposed to be information based, not useless flame-wars / drama. 
</li><li> Edits made should be as neutral as possible in your viewpoints. This means bias should not enter when you make edits (Example: Posting that Assassins are overpowered on the Assassin class page). 
</li><li> Vandalism is not welcome. Don't edit things just to spite other people. 
</li><li> Any rumors should not be posted. 
</li><li> Absolutely no data from private servers allowed! 
</li><li> Remember, both forums and wiki usage is a privilige, not a right. 
</li><li> Only use English when creating pages here, as this is an English fansite.
</li></ol>
<ul><li>If any problems arise, you may leave the admins a message <a class="mw-redirect" href="RW_ADMIN.html" title="RW:ADMIN">here</a>.
</li></ul>
<a name="Suggestions_that_are_strongly_recommended"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Suggestions that are strongly recommended</span></h2>
<p>Violating these won't remove your editing rights, but it is strongly suggested you follow them. 
</p>
<table class="prettytable">
<tr>
<td><b>We encourage users to be bold when updating pages. Wikis like ours develop faster when everybody helps to fix problems, correct grammar, add facts, make sure the wording is accurate, etc. We expect everyone to be bold and help make Requiem Wiki a better encyclopedia. rW not only allows you to add to, revise, and edit the article — it wants you to do it. It does require some amount of politeness, but it works. You will see. Also, of course, others here will edit what you write. Do not take it personally. They, like all of us, just want to make the wiki as good as it can possibly be.</b>
<p>Also, when you see a conflict in a talk page, do not be just a "mute spectator". Be bold and drop your opinion there.
</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>1. Make sure if you are working on a something with a guideline layout (such as working on classes, or skills), that it follows the existing format. This is for a conformity issue. Failure to follow this might result in your article being edited mercilessly. Deletion will only happen should it violate one of the ten rules above.
</p><p>2. Make sure your page conforms with existing pages of same type, meaning, if you are working on class pages, make sure its presentation style is same as other existing types.
</p><p>3. Try to follow currently existing templates for better uniformed entries. (Refer to Trans Char &amp; Skill Pages.)
</p><p>4. The article's writing style should not sound too opinionated or biased towards the writer.
</p><p>5. Obviously, if your edit is minor. Please do tick the minor edit box.
</p><p>6. Try to avoid phrases like "I think" or "this seems". These will be promptly removed.
</p><p>7. Write pages so they are written in genderless 3rd person singular or plural instead of 2nd person singular or 1st person plural. Basically avoid "you" and "we", "he/she", and use "(the) player", etc.

<p>Your next group of foes will be non-aggressive monsters. At first, it appears that there are only six, but they quickly multiply to about 30 or so. If you have Skill X, you can use it on three of the six groups before they can split, effectively killing about 15 monsters.
